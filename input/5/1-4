    The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> flight attendant in the rear of the plane making a
short flight to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charlotte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>, kept peeking around the corner of
a seat in Row 21, making 9-month-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danasia Brown</ENAMEX> laugh.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Like most of the two million infants under 2 who fly with their
parents every year, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danasia</ENAMEX> was traveling for free, seated on her
mother's lap.
<p>
   As the DC-9 approached the airport on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 2, 1994</TIMEX>, wind shear
slammed the plane to the ground.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tywonda Brown</ENAMEX>'s daughter was flung out of her arms. ``I tried to
hold on to her,'' she told federal safety investigators. ``I tried
to hold her and I couldn't.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danasia</ENAMEX> died of blunt force trauma after being hurled through
the plane at more than 120 miles per hour, battered by several
seats and parts of the cabin. She was one of 37 people to die in
the crash.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">For 16 years</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> has tried
to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> to require that children
under 2 wear child-safety restraint systems, such as those in cars.
<p>
   In a letter <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last May</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> administrator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hinson</ENAMEX>, the
board's chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Hall</ENAMEX>, referred to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danasia</ENAMEX>, saying, ``The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safety Board</ENAMEX> believes that if the child had been properly
restrained in a child restraint system, she might not have
sustained fatal injuries.''
<p>
   ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safety Board</ENAMEX> is disappointed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s inadequate
actions regarding the required use of child restraint systems,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> wrote.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association of Flight Attendants</ENAMEX>, a union representing more
than 36,000 flight attendants at 24 airlines, is even more
emphatic.
<p>
   ``It is inconceivable, given the strict rules of everything on
the aircraft  &MD;  from coffee pots to carry-on baggage  &MD;  that must be
tied down or securely stowed for takeoff and landing, or in flight
when the captain thinks it is necessary, that the same
consideration is not given to human beings, even though they are
under the age of 2,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patricia Friend</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFA</ENAMEX>, which
started a public education campaign <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> calling for
mandatory use of child restraint seats.
<p>
   So far, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, which regulates commercial aviation and ensures
the safety of the flying public, has refused to demand safety seats
for infants.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> released a report to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> that theorized
many families faced with purchasing a seat for an infant, estimated
to add <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200</NUMEX> to the cost of the trip, would take to the highways
rather than fly. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Over 10 years</TIMEX>, some 82 children whose parents
decided to drive rather than fly, would die in traffic accidents,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> predicted.
<p>
   At the same time, the number of infants killed in commercial air
crashes is extremely low. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> attributes the deaths of five
children in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last eight years</TIMEX> to lack of safety restraints.
<p>
   ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> wants to educate parents rather than mandate a rule,''
said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> spokeswoman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alison Duquette</ENAMEX>. ``We would force many parents
with young children onto the road.''
<p>
   However, advocates for laws requiring child seats &UR;  &LR; note that the
airlines fight to keep customers and the industry devised frequent
flier rewards. Proponents of safety seats are confident the
industry would come up with a pricing scheme to keep the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">one
percent</NUMEX> of all passengers who fly with infants.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Transport Association</ENAMEX>, representing 21 commercial
carriers, agreed.
<p>
   ``It is always difficult as an association to make comments
about pricing because of antitrust laws,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATA</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim
Neale</ENAMEX>. ``But certainly, (they) make a good point.''
<p>
   While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATA</ENAMEX> advocated mandates in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, it now wants the
government to determine which child seats perform well and which
ones do not before implementing regulations.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s civil aeromedical institute in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> studied
child restraint systems and found that infants under 20 pounds
should be in aft facing safety seats and children two or older, but
under 40 pounds, should be in front-facing safety seats. Some
safety seats, such as booster seats, belly belts, and normal seat
belts for children under 40 pounds, did not provide adequate
protection.
<p>
   ``If you don't have your child restrained, it really doesn't
much matter in a high-impact accident,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> investigator
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nora Marshall</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Hughes</ENAMEX>, another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> survival specialist investigator said
that even at slow speeds, a parent's arms are not
enough &UR;  &LR; to &UR;  &LR; restrain a child.
<p>
   ``I know it must be very frustrating for parents, particularly
in an emergency, but when it comes right down to it, if the child
is not restrained, there is very little protection,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sylvia Tsao</ENAMEX> found that out with devastating results.
<p>
   She and her 22-month-old son, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evan</ENAMEX>, were on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX>
Flight 232 from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> when the tail engine blew
apart, resulting in a loss of all hydraulic power needed to control
the airplane.
<p>
   The 285 passengers and crew of 10 had more than 30 minutes to
prepare for an emergency landing at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sioux City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iowa</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Flight attendants, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan Brown-Lohr</ENAMEX>, instructed
passengers on the brace position and told the parents of the four
lap infants to follow a prescribed procedure of wrapping their
children in blankets and pillows, and placing them on the floor of
the DC-10.
<p>
   ``I remember being in the brace position with my son's head
tucked between my knees, my left hand holding his ankle, my face
pushing down on his head, my legs outside his legs,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsao</ENAMEX> told
investigators.
<p>
   ``Suddenly, the world seemed to end. I saw for an instant my
son's body floating and flying at a very high rate of speed down
the right aisle towards the back of the plane, his head first, his
face away from me. He must have been traveling at an incredible
speed.''
<p>
   When the plane stopped cartwheeling, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsao</ENAMEX> shouted for her son,
but could not go back to where she thought he was. Another
passenger convinced her to leave the plane, which was quickly
filling with a choking smoke. It was the smoke, an autopsy
revealed, that killed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evan</ENAMEX>, not injuries from the crash.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown-Lohr</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manchester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.H.</ENAMEX>, native stayed in the plane until
the smoke forced her out.
<p>
   ``When I left, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sylvia</ENAMEX> was the first person I saw in the
cornfield,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown-Lohr</ENAMEX> recalled in an interview. ``She was trying
to go back to the plane. I stood in front of her and said, `You
can't go back.' She said she had to get her son and then said, `You
told me to put my baby on the floor and I did and now he's gone.'
<p>
   ``At that point, I didn't have any feeling at all. The hair on
the back of my neck stood up and I knew that I would have to live
with that for the rest of my life.
<p>
   ``I know what my responsiblity is: to keep every passenger in
the cabin safe. I cannot do that if a child is sitting on a lap.
The agency with responsibility for airline safety is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and
they are not doing their job.''
<p>
   Since the crash, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown-Lohr</ENAMEX> has worked to have child seats
mandated, either by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> or through legislation. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Next month</TIMEX>, she
said she will come to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> to give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> crew members letters to
send to their representatives urging action.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown-Lohr</ENAMEX> has not spoken to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsao</ENAMEX> since their encounter in the
cornfield. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsao</ENAMEX>, who now lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, declined to comment
about the accident. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> says she hopes to speak with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsao</ENAMEX> one
day.
<p>
   ``I am waiting until we succeed with this campaign. I couldn't
do anything for him that day, but this is what I can do and it
could give his life some meaning.''
<p>
   Some parents have voluntarily started buying seats for their
infants under two  &MD;  and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown-Lohr</ENAMEX> praises them every time she sees
one on a flight.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tywonda Brown</ENAMEX> was told it was not necessary.
<p>
   ``They told me I could hold her on my lap. I would have paid for
her to sit in a seat,'' she said. ``I would have given my life for
her. She wasn't here that long. She just turned nine months old.''

<p>
   Shortly after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fossett</ENAMEX>'s launching <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> his competitors sent
him telegrams of congratulation.
<p>
   The British balloon, called the Virgin Global Challenger, is to
be flown by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Branson</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virgin Atlantic Airways</ENAMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Per Lindstrand</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lindstrand Balloons Ltd.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oswestry</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX>, and an Irish balloonist, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rory McCarthy</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Branson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindstrand</ENAMEX>, who have set several ballooning records,
were the first pilots of hot-air balloons to cross both the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindstrand</ENAMEX> said that because of unfavorable weather patterns
over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX> he and his colleagues had decided to launch their
Virgin Global Challenger from a military airfield at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marrakech</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Morocco</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   To move the big crew capsule, balloon and accessories, the
British group chartered a Beluga transport plane  &MD;  a modified
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airbus</ENAMEX> 300 similar to the Pregnant Guppy aircraft used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> to
transport large rocket components. The flight to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Morocco</ENAMEX> is
scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindstrand</ENAMEX> said the balloon launching
would probably take place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day or so later</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Branson</ENAMEX>, chairman of the multifaceted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virgin Group</ENAMEX>, which
includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virgin Atlantic Airways</ENAMEX>, believes that his competitor,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fossett</ENAMEX>, faces grave risks.
<p>
   ``Because his capsule is not pressurized,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Branson</ENAMEX> said in an
interview, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX> will have to stay at around 20,000 feet, which
is usually well below the core of the jet stream. That could slow
him down a lot. We will be at 30,000 to 35,000 feet, where our
chances of riding the high-speed jet stream are much better.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX> is incredibly brave, and if anyone should beat us, I'd
rather it was he.''
<p>
   The Dutch team, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henk Brink</ENAMEX>, recently tested the inflation
of its Unicef Flyer balloon at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape Kennedy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s huge Vehicle
Assembly Building, where space shuttles are prepared for flight.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brink</ENAMEX>, who intends to launch his balloon from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nijmegen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">the
Netherlands</ENAMEX>, is a helicopter instructor and veteran balloonist.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, he, his wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evelien</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Hageman</ENAMEX>, a Dutch
fighter pilot, became the first European balloonists to cross the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>; so precise was their navigation that they landed within a
few miles of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brink</ENAMEX>'s home in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">the Netherlands</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Although balloons must travel in the same direction as the wind
that carries them along, a pilot can navigate to some extent by
changing altitude to seek wind headed in the desired direction.
Even a small change in altitude can result in a large change in
direction.
<p>
   The Unicef Flyer flight suffered a setback <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 26</TIMEX> when its
third crew member, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wouter Bakker</ENAMEX>, resigned from the flight crew
``for personal reasons.''
<p>
   Days before the expected launching <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brink</ENAMEX> said in an
interview that he had advertised for a replacement, stipulating
that the third crew member should be an airline captain.
<p>
   ``We're down to three candidates,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brink</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, ``and all
of them are completely familiar with our navigation and
communication equipment. For the launch and landing, I will do the
piloting.''
<p>
   All three teams are flying Rozier balloons  &MD;  a type that has
achieved many long-distance records in recent years.
<p>
   A modern Rozier is kept aloft by helium gas, but to add extra
lift, the balloon is compartmentalized and the lower part can be
filled with hot air from a gas burner. This enables the balloon to
maintain altitude at night, when cold air and the lack of sunlight
cools the helium and lessens its lifting power.
<p>
   Since the first manned balloon flight in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1783</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Francois
Pilatre de Rozier</ENAMEX> and the Marquis <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francois Laurent d'Arlandes</ENAMEX> in a
Montgolfier hot-air balloon, many balloonists have attempted
round-the-world flights, but all have failed, and some have died
trying.
<p>
   Five unsuccessful attempts were made by a single team led by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Newman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scottsdale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz.</ENAMEX>, in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Earthwinds</ENAMEX> balloon before
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newman</ENAMEX> abandoned his efforts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year ago</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The Rozier balloon is named after its inventor, who was forced
to use inflammable hydrogen in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> version, since a
century was to pass before the discovery of nonflammable helium.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rozier</ENAMEX> was killed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1785</TIMEX> while trying to cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">English
Channel</ENAMEX>; his hydrogen-and-hot-air hybrid balloon caught fire and
crashed.
<p>
   From that time until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>, balloonists relied almost exclusively
on hydrogen or helium for lift, since hot-air burners were regarded
as too dangerous.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SEATTLE</ENAMEX>  &MD;  A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Week</ENAMEX> report questions the safety of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s new 777 jetliner and says the company has been in a
``contentious debate'' with federal aviation officials over
possible design flaws.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> vigorously defended the company's newest
airplane and sharply criticized the magazine for publishing ``an
article with conclusions based on innuendo, hearsay and anonymous
sources.'' The company also said the magazine refused an invitation
for a briefing.
<p>
   In its latest edition out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Week</ENAMEX> says senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> officials downplayed the safety
concerns of their own engineers in certification tests on the 777.
The story also says that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">for more than two years</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> officials have
been engaged in a debate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> over possible design flaws in
the aircraft's engines.
<p>
   Quoting mostly unidentified sources, the article says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>
engineers feared that if a fan blade on one of the 777's engines
broke during flight, the engine would become unbalanced and produce
vibrations that could cause the aircraft to lose stability.
<p>
   ``It's an issue of safety,'' one unidentified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> engine
specialist is quoted as saying. ``It could lead to catastrophe.''
<p>
   The magazine also quotes anonymous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> sources who question
whether the airplane has been adequately tested.
<p>
   In reply, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> said: ``No one is more interested in building a
safe airplane than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> and we stand behind the safety and
reliability of our products. No airplane in history has been tested
as thoroughly as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 777.''
<p>
   The magazine says numerous sources told it during a four-month
investigation that pressure to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s planned certification
date led the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> to overrule safety concerns.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Week</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> executives refused to comment
for the article, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> spokeswoman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donna Mikov</ENAMEX> said the
magazine never acknowledged an offer for background briefings on
the certification process.
<p>
   She said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Week</ENAMEX> approached <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> with ``preconceived
data that had not been researched thoroughly.''
<p>
   ``It is clear to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Week</ENAMEX> only wanted answers
to specific speculative questions without prior knowledge and
background on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 777 project or the certification
process,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikov</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   In the article, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, defend
the aircraft and the agency's safety review process.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandra Allen</ENAMEX>, assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> administrator for public affairs in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that the agency had not yet read
the piece but that ``the record is clear that the testing and
analysis of the B-777 were unprecedented in their scope and
breadth.
<p>
   ``The certification process for this aircraft exceeded 125,000
staff hours by technical experts at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>. The agency maintains
complete confidence in the certification process.''
<p>
   The three makers of engines for the 777  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pratt &AMP; Whitney</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rolls Royce</ENAMEX>  &MD;  also denied any problems, the
magazine says.
<p>
   But the magazine says there are serious concerns about the size
and weight of the fan blades in the 777 engines.
<p>
   Fan blade breaks have been reported in 24 other jet airliners
since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, the article said. Although no crashes have resulted
from such breaks, the magazine says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> safety experts fear that
with the greater size and weight of the 777's blades, a break might
shake the cockpit so badly that pilots could not read the flight
instruments, increasing the risk of a crash. Despite the worries,
the FAA sources say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> appears to have done only limited
testing to see how the 777 would react if a blade broke.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> officials maintain they cooperated fully with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>
``in conducting the most rigorous laboratory, ground and flight
testing program in the history of commercial aviation.''
<p>
   The company added: ``We stand behind that process and fully
support the regulatory agencies in meeting the stringent
requirements for testing and certifying all versions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>
777.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s 777, a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4 billion</NUMEX> aircraft, is the world's largest
two-engine passenger jet. Its engines are the largest ever made for
a commercial airplane and have unusually heavy fan blades  &MD;  48
pounds in the largest configuration. The outer portions of 777
engines are so big that the body of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737 could fit inside
one.
<p>
   Because the 777 is equipped with two engines instead of four,
airline pilot and passenger groups initially voiced concerns about
flying the computer-designed aircraft on long-range, over-water
routes.
<p>
   But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last May</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> gave the 777 unprecedented approval to
fly extended-range twin-engine operations, known as ETOPs, those
same groups praised it as one of the most technologically advanced
in aviation history.
<p>
   As a result of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s flight-test program  &MD;  which included
1,000 takeoffs and landings to simulate a year's worth of
commercial service for one plane  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> officials said the 777 would
be ``the finest, most reliable and safest airplane ever
delivered.''
<p>
   During its testing program, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> was required to prove that,
in the event of a single-engine failure, the 777 could safely
continue flying for up to three hours.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julian Hill</ENAMEX>, a research chemist whose accidental discovery of a
tough, taffylike compound revolutionized everyday life after it
proved its worth in warfare and courtship, died on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hockessin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Del.</ENAMEX> He was 91.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX> died at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cokesbury Village</ENAMEX> retirement community, where
he had lived in recent years with his wife <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="62 years">of 62 years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Polly</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   During the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1920s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX> was a member of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont Co.</ENAMEX> team
studying the behavior of certain molecules that chain together to
form larger ones, called polymers. The chemists were engaged in
pure research, though finding a substitute for silk was in the back
of their minds.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1930</TIMEX>, while trying to create ever larger structures by
adjusting the amount of water in a batch of carbon- and
alcohol-based molecules, the team came up with a concoction that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du
Pont</ENAMEX>'s research head, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace Carothers</ENAMEX>, thought useless.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX> was intrigued after sticking a heated glass rod into a
beaker containing the material and finding that it stretched and
pulled, like taffy, and that it became silky when stretched at room
temperature. Soon, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX> and his colleagues were playing with the
material in the corridor and finding that it could be shaped into
strands that were remarkably long and strong.
<p>
   The substance, of course, was nylon, although it would not be so
named until it was introduced at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939</TIMEX> World's Fair in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>
 &MD;  hence, the ``ny'' in nylon.
<p>
   ``I tell my wife I was something better than a good scientist,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX> recalled in an interview years later. ``I was lucky.'' Since
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX> held the patents to nylon, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX> made no great fortune off
the discovery, but his wife said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> that the company had
treated him well over the years.
<p>
   (A sad footnote is the fate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carothers</ENAMEX>. Beset by personal
problems that fueled depression, thinking himself a failure despite
a brilliant career, he committed suicide in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX> at the age of 41.)
<p>
   If the development of nylon was in part serendipity, it was not
a total surprise. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Almost a decade earlier</TIMEX>, at an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Chemical
Society</ENAMEX> conference in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Buffalo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carothers</ENAMEX> reported on
progress in developing ``artificial silks'' like rayon, which was
then coming into use.
<p>
   But rayon is derived from cellulose and in that sense is not
strictly synthetic, as is nylon. Nylon was used initially for
toothbrush bristles, fishing line and surgical sutures. Nylon
stockings were first sold in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939</TIMEX>. They cost twice what silk
stockings did, and women were happy to pay. Nylon stockings were
sheer and strong.
<p>
   The material was deemed so important that its use was restricted
to the military after the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> entered World War II. Nylon
was used to make rope, tents, aircraft tires and parachutes.
<p>
   It also served to improve British-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> relations, in a way.
Young American soldiers stationed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> made a good impression
on their dates by giving them nylon stockings, available from the
military's post exchanges when they could not be bought elsewhere.
<p>
   The reintroduction of nylon to civilian life after the war
caused a sensation, and at least one stampede. A crowd of 10,000
people jammed a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> department store in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>, causing the
nylon sale to be called off.
<p>
   In the decades since, nylon has become ubiquitous, as carpeting
and clothing. And about two-thirds of all the luggage manufactured
in the world is made from it.
<p>
   Scientists consider nylon a benign product of technology,
because it has not been found to have any deadly side effects. But
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX>, who loved wildlife and was a dedicated bird-watcher, said in
a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> interview that he thought ``the human race is going to
perish by being smothered in plastic.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julian Werner Hill</ENAMEX> was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, graduated from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington University</ENAMEX> there in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1924</TIMEX> and earned a doctorate in
organic chemistry from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1928</TIMEX>. His wife recalled on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> that his doctoral studies were
delayed a year because he was stricken with scarlet fever.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX> played the violin and was an accomplished squash player and
figure-skater until his early 40s, when an attack of polio weakened
one leg, his wife said.
<p>
   Before his retirement from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX> supervised the
company's program of aid to universities for research in physics
and chemistry.
<p>
   Surviving besides his wife are a daughter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louisa Spottswood</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>; two sons, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Villanova</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jefferson</ENAMEX>,
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, and five grandchildren.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santo Domingo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dominican Republic</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 7</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- A
chartered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 757 carrying German tourists from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dominican
Republic</ENAMEX> crashed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" MIN="Caribbean">Caribbean sea</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX>, leaving no sign
that any of the 189 people on board survived.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Coast Guard</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> said it recovered 79 bodies in the
area of the crash, before suspending its search at nightfall <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
It plans to continue the search in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``We'll continue searching until there is reason to believe
there are no survivors,'' said Petty Officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Carr</ENAMEX>, a
spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this evening</TIMEX>. ``We still maintain
hope that somebody is out there and we will try to find them.''
<p>
   Searchers did find some life rafts, but no survivors, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast
Guard</ENAMEX> said. It wasn't clear whether the rafts were dragged out by
survivors or if they inflated on impact.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dominican Republic</ENAMEX> officials said the cause of the
crash was unknown. The owner of the German tour agency that
chartered the plane was quoted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reuters</ENAMEX> as saying lightning
struck the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>-bound 757.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vural Oeger</ENAMEX>, head of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hamburg</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oeger Tours</ENAMEX>, said he was told
by Dominican aviation officials that the plane's engines were
damaged by lightning. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reuters</ENAMEX> also said the pilots apparently tried
to turn the plane around to return to the airport, but were unable
to and plunged into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   A spokeswoman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">German Foreign Ministry</ENAMEX> said that while
she'd heard rumors of lightning causing the wreck, she couldn't
confirm the reports.
<p>
   The plane crashed just before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight local time</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last night</TIMEX>,
about five minutes after taking off from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Plata</ENAMEX> airport
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dominican Republic</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> officials said rain and
sharks were hampering the rescue efforts.
<p>
   A spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX> said it was sending
a team to help investigate the crash.
<p>
   The aircraft, owned by Turkish company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birgen Air</ENAMEX>, was leased to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alas de Transporte Internacional</ENAMEX>, a Dominican charter airline that
operates mainly during the peak winter season when European
tourists visit the resort town of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Plata</ENAMEX>, said a spokeswoman
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeronautica Civil</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dominican Republic</ENAMEX>'s aviation agency.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON|ORGANIZATION">Oeger</ENAMEX> had chartered the plane from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alas</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The aircraft, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>, carried 176 passengers, most of
them German tourists, and 13 crew members -- 11 Turkish nationals
and two Dominicans.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russ Young</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> spokesman, said the investigation could
last weeks or months.
<p>
   The jet was the 31st <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 757 made and was originally sold to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Air Lines</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>, which became a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Air
Corp.</ENAMEX> after filing for bankruptcy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Brodie</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rolls-Royce Plc</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, said
the plane was fitted with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rolls-Royce</ENAMEX> RB211-535 engines. He said
the power plant was ``one of the most reliable engines in
service.''
<p>
   The company had no idea yet what went wrong and there was no
immediate evidence that the engines were to blame.
<p>
   The crash was the second of a 757 in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than two months</TIMEX>. On
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 20</TIMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> jet crashed in the mountains near
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cali</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombia</ENAMEX>, killing 160 of the 164 people on board. The cause
of that crash is still under investigation.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dominican Republic</ENAMEX>, which shares the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hispaniola</ENAMEX>
with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Haiti</ENAMEX>, is the most popular <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> destination for Germans.
Hundreds of thousands of German tourists visit the island each
year, attracted by its low prices and tropical beaches.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oeger</ENAMEX> is one of a number of discount tour agencies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>
which charters planes to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dominican Republic</ENAMEX>.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 757 carrying 189 people, mostly tourists
on their way home to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berlin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dominican
Republic</ENAMEX>, crashed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late Tuesday</TIMEX> about 13 miles
offshore. At least 105 bodies were recovered, American officials
said.
<p>
   Debris was spread in an area two miles long and 150 yards wide,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Coast Guard</ENAMEX> said, suggesting that the jet broke
up before it hit the water.
<p>
   But an official at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">German Embassy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santo Domingo</ENAMEX>, the
capital of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dominican Republic</ENAMEX>, said the fuel had not caught
fire, indicating that the plane had not exploded.
<p>
   The official, the first secretary at the embassy, said bad
weather was likely the cause.
<p>
   ``More than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX>, it was the interference of bad
weather,'' the official, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klaus D. Brock</ENAMEX>, said in a telephone
interview. The plane had taken off from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Plata</ENAMEX>, about 100
miles northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santo Domingo</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The crash was the second recent loss of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 757 in flight:
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> a 757 crashed near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cali</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombia</ENAMEX>; pilot error appears
to have been the primary cause.
<p>
   Aviation officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Plata</ENAMEX> gave conflicting information
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> about the flight, which reached an altitude of about
7,000 feet before crashing.
<p>
   Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hector Ramon</ENAMEX>, head of the civil aviation agency, said the
pilot had radioed the tower that he had a problem and was
returning, news reports said. But Maj. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emmanuel Souffront</ENAMEX>, of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dominican Air Force</ENAMEX>, said a transcript of radio communication with
air traffic controllers indicated there had not been a problem.
<p>
   ``The aircraft started to turn to the right and disappeared from
the radar screen,'' he was quoted as saying.
<p>
   ``Before it went down, someone radioed from the aircraft, `Stand
by.'''
<p>
   In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berlin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>, friends and family of the passengers
arrived at the airports to find flags flying at half staff and
teams of doctors, psychologists and clergy to meet them.
<p>
   The 11-year-old plane, originally built for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Air Lines</ENAMEX>,
was owned by a Turkish company and under lease, with a crew, to a
Dominican airline, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alas de Transporte Internacional</ENAMEX>, for a single
flight. It carried 176 passengers, including 4 children. Eleven of
the crew were Turkish and two Dominican.
<p>
   The Turkish company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birgen Air</ENAMEX>, was using the plane to fill a
charter commitment to a German company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oger Tours</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hamburg</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfgang Schwalm</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> airport, said the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 757 had replaced a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 767 at the last minute because the
767 had technical problems.
<p>
   In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Istanbul</ENAMEX>, the general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birgen</ENAMEX> said on television
that he believed the plane had been hit by lightning. But the jet
is designed to withstand any such strikes.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Coast Guard</ENAMEX> dispatched three cutters to help
retrieve bodies. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> sent two civil aviation officials and
three officials from the federal police in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Weisbaden</ENAMEX> to help
identify bodies.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> said it would send experts
to assist investigators, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety
Board</ENAMEX> said it would send investigators if more evidence became
available.
<p>
   But it was not clear who would pay to retrieve the plane's data
recorder from the wreckage, off the north coast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dominican
Republic</ENAMEX> where the water is about 3,000 feet deep. Retrieval could
cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of thousands of dollars</NUMEX>. Though the plane was
American built, neither it nor the airline nor the flight was under
American jurisdiction, and no Americans were on board.
<p>
   Nevertheless, American safety experts said they would be very
interested in learning more about the crash if it was caused by
mechanical problems or by weather.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAVY</ENAMEX> TO HUNT FOR BLACK BOX FROM AIR CRASH
(HLW)

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">UPPER MARLBORO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Md.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> said here on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that it had
shipped equipment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dominican Republic</ENAMEX> to help find the flight
data recorder of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 757 that crashed offshore on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, killing all 189 people on board.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> officials said they had been asked to locate the so-called
black box, but so far have not been asked to help retrieve it or
any other parts of the wreckage. In the meantime, discussions
continued about who would pay to salvage parts of the jet.
<p>
   The Turkish-owned charter jet, which was leased to a Dominican
airline, was carrying German tourists home from a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>
vacation when it plunged into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> shortly after takeoff
from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Plata</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dominican Republic</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Late on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Plata</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> said
it had given up its search, and it remained uncertain exactly how
many bodies had been accounted for.
<p>
   Dominican officials said 128 bodies had been recovered. A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> spokesman said local people in boats appeared to have
stripped some bodies of money and identification.
<p>
   After the crash, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dominican Republic</ENAMEX> asked for help from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>, which in turn called in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Capt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Scott McCord</ENAMEX>, supervisor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s salvage and
diving operations, said at a briefing here on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 757 went down in an area where the water is from 1,000 feet
to 13,000 feet deep, with the sea bottom flat in some parts and
jagged in others.
<p>
   Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCord</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> had retrieved wreckage in more
challenging places, he declined to predict the likelihood of
success in recovering the black box in this case, or what it would
cost.
<p>
   The black boxes on passenger jets are equipped with metal
cylinders that emit a ``ping'' sound when immersed in water.
<p>
   So far, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> has sent a Towed Ping Locator System, also
known as a tow fish, to the area. The device is pulled on a cable,
about 2,500 feet above the ocean floor, at 2 to 3 knots, and,
depending on water conditions, it can hear the pinger on the black
box at a distance of up to a mile.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> officials and aviation experts plan to review air traffic
control radar and other data in an effort to narrow the search
area. When they finish, probably on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, they will
begin surveying the ocean, he said.
<p>
   ``Looking for anything on the ocean floor is very difficult,
because you are working blind,'' he said. ``The analogy is a needle
in a haystack. But with a pinger locator, you know which side of
the haystack you're looking at.''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> also showed off a bigger robot probe that would carry
out the next step, making sonar maps of the bottom, to locate the
debris fields. A third remote-controlled device, with video and
still cameras and manipulator arms, would then be sent down. All
three are towed by a ship, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> is now negotiating with
commercial ship owners for a suitable vessel, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCord</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   No one would say what such an operation would cost.
<p>
   At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Benson</ENAMEX>, a
spokesman, said, ``any costs are expected to be incurred on a
cost-sharing basis.''
<p>
   ``We certainly have a strong interest in that aircraft; it's our
aircraft,'' he said.
<p>
   ``There are others who have an equally strong interest,'' he
said, citing ``countries and corporate entities.'' These would
apparently include <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Turkey</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dominican Republic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alas de Transporte Internacional</ENAMEX>, which leased the plane, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birgenair</ENAMEX>, a small Turkish company that owned the plane and
provided the crew.

<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> underestimated the number of
aircraft flying over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantex Weapons Plant</ENAMEX> outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amarillo</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, where much of the nation's surplus plutonium is stored,
according to computerized studies under way by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy
Department</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> counted each flight at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amarillo International Airport</ENAMEX>
once. But military training planes make up to 30 passes per flight
over the plant, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety
Board</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy</ENAMEX> and local farmers have expressed concern
that a plane crash into a plutonium storage bunker at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantex</ENAMEX> could
spread radioactive smoke for miles. Plutonium, a highly radioactive
element, causes cancer if inhaled.
<p>
   The risk of that scenario, previously estimated at one chance in
10 million, is expected to increase when current flight data are
analyzed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later this year</TIMEX>, according to a safety board memo dated
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``This doesn't surprise me at all,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trish Neusch</ENAMEX>, who
farms land near the plant 17 miles northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amarillo</ENAMEX> and 7
miles from the airport. ``We are out there and see these planes all
the time.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike McNulty</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> air traffic manager at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amarillo
International</ENAMEX>, said the previous aircraft count, conducted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late
1994</TIMEX>, was a ``manual count on a pad,'' done informally by air
traffic controllers.
<p>
   That 60-day accounting estimated that 25 planes a day entered
flight patterns over the zone where plutonium is stored in concrete
bunkers covered with earth and grass.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantex</ENAMEX> is operated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX> through a private
contractor and employs 3,600 workers, whose main mission is to
dismantle nuclear warheads. The hollow plutonium ball at the core
of each weapon is stored at the former weapons assembly plant.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" MIN="Amarillo">Amarillo airport</ENAMEX> averages 250 takeoffs and landings per day,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNulty</ENAMEX> said. About half the aircraft are military planes assigned
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> bases in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, he
said.
<p>
   About <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 percent</NUMEX> of the airport traffic enters a flight pattern
over the plutonium storage bunkers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNulty</ENAMEX> said. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">For the past 14
months</TIMEX>, air traffic controllers have tried to steer planes away
from the bunkers, he said.
<p>
   Two of the airport's dozen flight paths are directly above the
nuclear storage area, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNulty</ENAMEX> said. One approach will be eliminated
by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late summer</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early fall</TIMEX> when a new instrument landing system
is installed, he said.
<p>
   The second flight path cannot be altered until sophisticated
equipment, called VORTAC, is phased out at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas/Fort Worth
Airport</ENAMEX> and installed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amarillo</ENAMEX>, he said. There is no target date
for the transition.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNulty</ENAMEX> downplayed the dangers posed by some military traffic by
noting that these planes often fly at high altitudes and stay 2 to
8 miles from the plutonium area.
<p>
   ``They are counting something at 35,000 as well as 500 feet,
when in actuality a plane would have to start falling in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>
to hit the plant,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNulty</ENAMEX> said. ``They are just collecting a lot
of raw data.''

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 15</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes Aircraft Corp.</ENAMEX>, the
satellite-making arm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX>, delayed shipment of a new
satellite to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX>'s launch failure by a Chinese
rocket, a company official said.
<p>
   ``It's been delayed,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K.C. Lang</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> executive in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>. ``It's been held off and we don't know when it's coming.''
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">This morning</TIMEX>'s launch failure, in which a rocket exploded
shortly after lifting off, cast doubt on whether <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> will be able
to complete an ambitious schedule of satellite launches.
<p>
   ``There may be adjustments to our future plans because of the
accident,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Lihui</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for the rocketmaker,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Great Wall Industry Corp.</ENAMEX> ``I can't tell you anything about
the possible changes now.''
<p>
   The next launch -- of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX>-built Apstar-1A communications
satellite -- is scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-March</TIMEX> aboard a Long March 3
rocket built by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Great Wall</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The customer is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APT Satellite Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, whose
shareholders include commercial arms of the Chinese army, space and
telecommunications authorities, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singapore Telecom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thailand</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charoen Pokhpand Group</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   A Long March 3-B rocket carrying an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX> satellite exploded
as it was being launched just after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3.00 a.m.</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, showering
debris on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Xichang</ENAMEX> launch site in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" MIN="China">southwest China</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sichuan</ENAMEX>
province.
<p>
   The rocket apparently exploded after rising just a few hundred
feet from its launch pad, crashing down on a road one mile away.
There are no reports of injuries.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Great Wall</ENAMEX> officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> said company executives
are locked in discussions in the capital and at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Xichang</ENAMEX> space
base to determine what went wrong.
<p>
   It was the first launch for the heavy payload-carrying Long
March 3-B vehicle, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Great Wall</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Xiaolin</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Clean-up operations to contain the spillage of hazardous
chemical wastes have begun. Numerous calls to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Xichang</ENAMEX> failed to
reach any officials.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s satellite launch track record has been patchy. In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1995</TIMEX>, a Long March 2-E rocket exploded one minute into its
flight, destroying the Apstar-2 satellite it carried.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> competes with American, European and Russian launchers on
the basis of price.
<p>
   An agreement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> was to
have curtailed Chinese price cutting to a maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX>
under <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> launch costs for proven vehicles.
<p>
   ``If the launch is successful, it will be terrific,'' the
official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing Youth Daily</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Great Wall</ENAMEX>
senior engineer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Long Lehou</ENAMEX> as saying. ``However, if it fails, the
consequences will be disastrous.''
<p>
   The failure delivered a blow to a group including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert
Murdoch</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> that planned to
use the spacecraft to beam television signals to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>. The
satellite was built by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The explosion is likely to raise the cost of insuring future
launches, analysts said. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Shanghai</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Pacific Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>
insured the Apstar-1A satellite for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.3 billion yuan</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$280 million</NUMEX>)
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, the official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Daily</ENAMEX> reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``Maybe the insurance policies will increase a lot for the Long
March family,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Ming</ENAMEX>, chief of the international business
department at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Pacific Insurance</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The 2-E and the untested 3-B versions of the Long March rockets
are considered by foreign analysts to be less reliable than the
Long March 3, which has had only one failure in more than 20
launches.
<p>
   The 2-E rockets are used to propel satellites into low orbits of
about 200 kilometers above the planet, while the 3-series rockets
can enable satellites to reach orbits out to 35,000 kilometers.
<p>
   This was to have been <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s busiest year of satellite
launches.
<p>
   After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</TIMEX>'s planned launch, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> plans to launch another
of its DongFangHong3 satellites on a Long March 3-A rocket in by
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>, a satellite for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EchoStar
Communications Corp.</ENAMEX> is due to be launched on a Long March 2-E.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last December</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> successfully launched an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echostar</ENAMEX> satellite
from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Xichang</ENAMEX>, the most recent Chinese success.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, a Long March 3 rocket is to scheduled to carry a
ChinaSat-7 communications satellite for a Chinese-controlled
company. The satellite is to be built by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes Aircraft Co.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July-August</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> plans to launch a recoverable spy
satellite aboard a Long March 2-C rocket from its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jiuquan</ENAMEX> launch
base in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gansu</ENAMEX> province.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Later in the year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> hopes to win a bid to launch the
Mabuhay communications satellite for a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manila</ENAMEX>-based consortium led

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 22</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> ordered its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop
Grumman Corp.</ENAMEX> F-14s out of the skies for three days while it
investigates three recent F-14 crashes.
<p>
   The action came after an F-14A fighter crashed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX>. The two crew members ejected and were rescued and
returned to the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz with minor injuries,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, an F-14D crashed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Ocean</ENAMEX> off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" MIN="California">southern
California</ENAMEX>, killing its two crew members. And on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 29</TIMEX>, an F-14A
crashed into houses in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee</ENAMEX>, after takeoff, killing
the two crew members and three people on the ground.
<p>
   The cause of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s crash is undetermined.
<p>
   ``In light of the recent mishaps involving F-14As and Ds, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> has ordered a 72-hour safety standdown for all F-14
aircraft,'' said Lt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg Geisen</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> spokesman at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``Although different models of the F-14 have been involved in
these mishaps, it is prudent to temporarily suspend routine flight
operations for all F-14s in order to assess the available
information and determine if procedural or other modifications to
F-14 operations are warranted,'' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   A one-time exception to the standdown will be allowed for 14
F-14s on board the USS America, which is returning to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United
States</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosnia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geisen</ENAMEX> said. Those planes
will be permitted to fly to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oceana Naval Air Station</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX>, as
the ship nears port.
<p>
   The F14 ``Tomcat'' is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s first-line fighter aircraft. It
has two-engines and is capable of action in all weather, day or
night. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> has about 330 F-14s in three models, As, Bs and Ds.
<p>
   The models differ mainly in engines and avionics. The A model
uses engines from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pratt &AMP; Whitney</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Technologies
Corp.</ENAMEX> The B and D models use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric</ENAMEX> engines.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> said there have been F-14 32 crashes since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>. That
figure isn't uncommon for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> jet fighter aircraft, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geisen</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   The aircraft was introduced to the fleet in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid 1970s</TIMEX>, and
has undergone several upgrades since then, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geisen</ENAMEX> said. The planes
were made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grumman Corp.</ENAMEX>, now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop Grumman</ENAMEX>, principally in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calverton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>. The company delivered the last
F-14 to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop Grumman</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John
Vosilla</ENAMEX>. He referred all questions about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s crash to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Aviation safety and engineering experts will review the data
from the three recent crashes and are to present their findings to
the Chief of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naval Operations</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Boorda</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">in three days</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geisen</ENAMEX>
said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop Grumman</ENAMEX> shares were up 3/8 to 66 1/4 at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAVY</ENAMEX> GROUNDS F-14'S AFTER THIRD RECENT CRASH

<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> suspended operations for its entire fleet
of F-14 airplanes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> after the third ``Tomcat'' crash in a
month  &MD;  the second in a week.
<p>
   The 72-hour ``safety stand-down'' came shortly after an F-14
fighter from the USS Nimitz crashed during flight operations in the
northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> at about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6:30 a.m. EST</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> announced that the two Naval aviators on board were
rescued by a SH-60 helicopter after they ejected from the aircraft.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> said that both men were in good condition. One aviator
suffered minor abrasions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> is investigating the cause.
<p>
   Another Tomcat crashed off the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> during
exercises on the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>. Both crew
members were killed. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Late last month</TIMEX>, an F-14 crashed near
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX>, killing both crew members and three civilians on the
ground.
<p>
   Although the crash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> was the third Tomcat crash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this
year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Bacon</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> had
uncovered no evidence of a flaw in the aircraft.
<p>
   A safety stand-down is a procedure the military uses to conduct
an intensive review. During this three-day period, the three
classes of F-14s will stay out of the air so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> personnel can
review maintenance procedures and equipment, plus check each
aircraft for weaknesses or deficiencies.
<p>
   The F-14s on the deck of the USS America will be allowed to fly
off because the aircraft carrier is returning from a deployment.
Carrier decks are routinely cleared of aircraft the day before the
carrier docks.
<p>
   ``We do not know what has caused these three crashes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this
year</TIMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacon</ENAMEX> said. ``The goal of the stand-down is to take a time
out to look at everything involved with the F-14s.
<p>
   Adm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeremy Boorda</ENAMEX>, the chief of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naval Operations</ENAMEX>, informed
Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John White</ENAMEX> of the latest crash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> and told him he was ordering the standdown for the entire
fleet of more than 300 aircraft, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacon</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   ``What the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> is trying to do is find out what caused these
accidents,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacon</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
    &UR;  &LR; In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past five years</TIMEX>, 32 F-14s have crashed. One of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s first female pilots, Lt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kara Hultgren</ENAMEX>, died while trying to
land an F-14 on an aircraft carrier in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> concluded
that engine failure caused that crash.
<p>
   The Tomcat, a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$38 million</NUMEX>, twin-engine aircraft built by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grumman Aerospace Corp.</ENAMEX>, is the standard fighter plane used by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> for close-in air combat. The aircraft has been in operation
since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>. The oldest version of the aircraft, the F-14A, is
scheduled to be phased out by the year <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The crash rate for the F-14 dropped dramatically after the
initial years of deployment and has generally gone down since then
except for occasional spurts of accidents, according to Naval
records.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacon</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> had no single explanation for the increases
in F-14 accidents.
<p>
   ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> informs me that they have been unable to find a
common thread to these accidents,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacon</ENAMEX> said. ``This is a
mystery.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Navy</ENAMEX> ordered all of its F-14s out of the
skies for at least three days after one of them crashed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX>, the third crash of an F-14 in the last month.
<p>
   The two-man crew survived the crash, ejecting into the northern
waters of the gulf, and were rescued and returned to the carrier
Nimitz.
<p>
   The two crewmen, who were not identified, were reported to have
suffered minor injuries.
<p>
   The three-day shutdown of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s fleet of more than 330
F-14s was ordered by the chief of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">naval operations</ENAMEX>, Adm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeremy M.
Boorda</ENAMEX>, who said in an interview at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> that while there
was no immediate evidence of a connection among the three crashes,
``This is an airplane that we worry about.''
<p>
   ``A jinxed airplane?'' he said. ``No. But known deficiencies in
the earlier models? Yes, and we're working on that, including some
changes to the aircraft.''
<p>
   He said the three-day review might result in new restrictions on
use of the plane, nicknamed the Tomcat, which has the highest
accident rate for jet fighters in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> fleet. Ten F-14s have
gone down in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past two years</TIMEX>, and 32 since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>. Each plane
costs more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30 million</NUMEX>.
<p>
   ``We may come out with some more operational restrictions, but
it's way too early to say that,'' the admiral said. ``This is too
serious a business to be guessing about.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> officials said that during the shutdown, special engineers
and other safety experts would review the evidence available from
the three recent crashes and inspect the rest of the fleet for
defects in the planes, in their maintenance, or in pilot training.
<p>
   Earlier models of the fighter, called the F-14A, were plagued
with engine problems when they entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s fleet of
carrier-based jet fighters in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>. Specifically, the engines used
on the first model were not powerful enough for a fighter of its
size.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> was forced to impose strict restrictions on how pilots
could operate the aircraft, and had to replace many of the engines.
Two of the three planes that have crashed since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late January</TIMEX> were
F-14As.
<p>
   The engines installed in later models, the F-14B and the F-14D,
were more powerful and have proved more reliable. Despite the
troubles of the F-14 fleet, the rate of accidents among all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>
fighter planes has come down dramatically in recent years, a record
that has made the recent spate of crashes all the more alarming.
<p>
   In the first of the crashes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>, an F-14A crashed into a
residential neighborhood in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tenn.</ENAMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 29</TIMEX>, seconds
after takeoff. The two-man crew was killed, along with three people
on the ground. The pilot was involved in another F-14 crash in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last Sunday</TIMEX>, the crew of an F-14D was killed when the fighter
plunged into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> off the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern California</ENAMEX>
during exercises.
<p>
   The F-14 that crashed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> had flown from the Nimitz,
which is sailing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> to enforce a no-fly zone over
southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>, an operation that dates from the end of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> war
in the gulf. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> officials said that the plane was on a routine
training mission. They would not speculate on the cause of the
crash.
<p>
   The plane, which was manufacutred by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grumman Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long
Island</ENAMEX>, has gone out of production, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> has begun to phase
out the plane entirely, replacing it with the F-18.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Scavengers have descended on the wreckage of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> jetliner that crashed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombia</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last December</TIMEX>,
making off with more than 500 parts, including the jet engines, the
landing gear, and electronic components for possible sale to other
carriers, the airline said.
<p>
   A spokesman for the airline said that to its knowledge, no parts
of the plane had yet been offered for sale, and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> said it was notifying other
airlines of the possibility.
<p>
   Not long after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 757 jetliner crashed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Dec. 20</TIMEX> in a
remote mountain area near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Buga</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombia</ENAMEX>, killing 160 of the 164
people on board, the Colombian authorities said people were taking
valuables from the bodies of the dead passengers as well as the
luggage.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</TIMEX>, the airline sent other airlines and aviation
companies an 11-page list of the missing parts and their serial
numbers along with a letter warning: ``These parts could pose a
significant safety risk should they be installed on other aircraft
since they were involved in a crash.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hotard</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>, said by telephone: ``You
may have a part that looks perfectly good on the outside, but if
you get into some of the sophisticated testing, you may find out
it's not good.''
<p>
   Although the plane was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 757, flying from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cali</ENAMEX>,
many of the parts would also fit a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 767.
<p>
   The airline's letter, first reported in The Cleveland Plain
Dealer, noted: ``Any part taken from the crash site and/or offered
for sale without the express written approval of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines
Inc.</ENAMEX>, should be considered a stolen aircraft part.'' It cited
sections of federal law that made such activity illegal and
threatened that any supplier caught handling any of the parts would
be barred from doing business with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hotard</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> was not interested in the salvage
value of the parts but that some could be sold for a lot of money
if passed off as being in good condition. Testifying before a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> aviation subcommittee <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last June</TIMEX>, federal investigators said
various small parts of airplanes that are worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of dollars</NUMEX>
in new condition, are available for a few dollars from scrap
dealers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> and may find their way back into
airplanes, although the parts are not suitable.
<p>
   The local Colombian authorities did retrieve the black boxes
with cockpit voice and flight data recordings, and technicians at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> have
analyzed them. The safety board and the Colombian authorities
recently said there did not appear to be any mechanical problem
with the plane before the crash.
<p>
   That means that the stolen parts would probably not be useful in
determining the cause of this crash. In some other crashes,
investigators have sorted through tons of debris to find components
that offer clues.
<p>
   Stealing parts from crash scenes is not new. When a Colombian
DC-8 cargo plane crashed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 5</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asuncion</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paraguay</ENAMEX>, killing
23 people, local television showed a man stealing engine parts from
the debris, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Press</ENAMEX> reported. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>,
crash scenes are usually cordoned off, in part to protect the
evidence and to prevent the spread of blood-borne infection.
<p>
   A spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard F. Schleh</ENAMEX>, said the
company had helped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> distribute its letter, which he
described as ``a very good precautionary effort.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Gilligan</ENAMEX>, the deputy associate administrator for
regulation and certification at the aviation agency, said the
agency did not believe that parts had been stolen from planes that
had crashed in this country, but she said the agency did not know
what happened abroad.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William A. Machado</ENAMEX>, who heads an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> program to investigate
aircraft parts that are counterfeit or come from unapproved
suppliers, said of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> letter: ``It's the first time I've
seen it, but I can understand their concern, because they really
didn't have a lot of control.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Machado</ENAMEX> called the letter ``a
responsible action on their part.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> imposed new restrictions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> on
pilots who fly the F-14 jet fighter, after three of the
trouble-plagued jets crashed in the last month, killing four <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>
airmen and three civilians.
<p>
   While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> said it had found no common thread in the recent
crashes, it announced that it had placed temporary limitations on
the speed at which F-14s could be flown, and on the use of
afterburners, which give a plane extra thrust by injecting fuel
into hot exhaust gases.
<p>
   All F-14 pilots will also be required to undergo refresher
safety courses before they are allowed to fly again, a requirement
that could keep some grounded for several more days.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> made the announcement as it ended a three-day worldwide
shutdown on operations of the carrier-based F-14 Tomcat.
<p>
   In recent years the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s fleet of more than 330 F-14s has
suffered a series of catastrophic accidents, including a crash on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 29</TIMEX> in which one of the early models of the fighter, an F-14A,
smashed into a residential neighborhood in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX>, killing the
two-man crew and three civilians on the ground.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 18</TIMEX>, one of the latest models, an F-14D, went down off
the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">southern California</ENAMEX>, killing its two-person crew.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, an F-14A crashed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX>; the pilot
and radar operator survived with only minor injuries.
<p>
   The F-14 has the highest accident rate among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> combat planes,
and its problems have mounted even as the overall safety record for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> planes has improved dramatically in recent years. Ten F-14s
have gone down in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past two years</TIMEX>, and 32 since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>. Each plane
costs more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30 million</NUMEX>.
<p>
   In announcing the three-day halt to operations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>, the
Chief of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naval Operations</ENAMEX>, Adm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeremy M. Boorda</ENAMEX>, said that the
F-14 was ``an airplane that we worry about.'' Earlier models of the
plane had engines that were not powerful enough for a fighter of
its size, which led to restrictions on their use and, in some
cases, replacement of the engine.
<p>
   In a statement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> said that the new restrictions
on speed and on the use of afterburners would remain in effect
until the investigations of the three recent crashes had ended. The
statement did not rule out permanent restrictions in the future.
<p>
   ``It should be emphasized that the investigations continue to
determine causes and any permanent corrective action required,''
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> said. ``The requirements and limitations placed in effect
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> are intended to permit safe operation of the F-14 aircraft
pending completion of the investigations.''
<p>
   Under the restrictions, F-14 fighters cannot fly more than 550
nautical miles an hour, below an altitude of 10,000 feet.
Restrictions on the use of afterburners apply to later models of
the plane.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> officials said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> that the restrictions would not
affect the plane's usefulness, since the limitations would be
immediately waived in combat. ``If a pilot is out there and needs
to fly his airplane, he's going to fly his airplane as he needs
to,'' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> spokesman.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House National Security Committee</ENAMEX> has announced that
hearings would be held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX> on the safety record of the F-14.
The panel is expected to hear testimony from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> officials, pilots
and representatives of the manufacturer, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grumman Corp.</ENAMEX>, which
merged with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> Republicans who are sponsoring the hearings,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duncan Hunter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy Cunningham</ENAMEX>, both from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, said in a
statement that ``too many lives and too much equipment has been
lost'' in F-14 crashes. Although the plane's problems precede the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> administration by many years, the lawmakers said that they
planned to investigate whether the administration ``is underfunding
both the readiness and modernization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> aircraft.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SEATTLE</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> is borrowing
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737 from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Flight</ENAMEX> as part of its
investigation into why a similar jetliner crashed near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The museum's aircraft, ironically enough, was donated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX>,
which operated the airplane that crashed, killing 132 people on
board.
<p>
   The board is testing the plane's rudder controls to learn why
Flight 427 suddenly rolled and crashed while on its approach to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> airport <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 8, 1994</TIMEX>. Aviation safety investigators say
a sharp movement of the rudder  &MD;  the movable vertical piece in the
plane's tail  &MD;  could have caused the jet's deadly roll.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Hall</ENAMEX> is to address a briefing on the
investigation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, but board spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Benson</ENAMEX>
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> isn't expected to announce any findings.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benson</ENAMEX> said investigators are simulating air loads on the 737's
rudder. ``It's a slow, methodical job since we don't have adequate
black boxes,'' he said.
<p>
   Newer models of flight data recorders, or ``black boxes,'' would
record the angle of the rudder and the pedal controlling it. But
because the plane was reduced to debris by the force of the crash,
and the 737 was equipped with older-model flight recorders that
didn't measure such information, investigators are running tests to
``surmise'' rudder and pedal position, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benson</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Installation of improved flight recorders was an official
recommendation of the board after earlier hearings into the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> crash.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Flight</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Hayes</ENAMEX> said the plane, donated
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last September</TIMEX>, was to be partially dismantled as an exhibit. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> was looking for an intact plane on which to conduct tests, so
the museum delayed its plans.
<p>
   The tests are being conducted at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> hangar at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boeing
Field</ENAMEX>. No airborne tests are planned.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> also conducted tests <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last September</TIMEX> to determine if
wake turbulence from another plane could have contributed to the
crash. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benson</ENAMEX> said those results are still being analyzed.

RARE TESTING ON A 737 SEEKS ELUSIVE ANSWERS TO A CRASH
(bl)

<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Air safety investigators have begun highly unusual
tests on a parked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737, forcing parts askew with hydraulic
arms and clipping vital control cables in an effort to determine
why a sister plane owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> fell out of the sky near
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1994</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The investigation of that crash, which killed all 132 people on
board, is already the most extensive in the history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National
Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>. And in a way it is the most worrisome,
because the 737 is the most popular jet in the sky.
<p>
   The board finds the cause of almost all crashes by looking at
the wreckage, the flight data recorders, radar records and similar
evidence. But in this case, that has not been enough in this case.
<p>
   ``What we're doing to this airplane is unprecedented,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Hall</ENAMEX>, the safety board's chairman.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> said investigators had already invested more than 50,000
hours of engineering time in trying to find the cause of the crash,
making the inquiry the longest and costliest in the board's 29-year
history.
<p>
   The 737 that crashed was approaching <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> when it abruptly
rolled to the left and plunged to the ground at 300 miles an hour.
<p>
   Investigators say that its trajectory through the sky can be
explained by a sustained swing of the rudder  &MD;  the moveable surface
on the vertical tail  &MD;  and by nothing else that they can identify.
<p>
   It is not clear, though, how the rudder could have
malfunctioned.
<p>
   So technicians have pulled the floor out of the passenger cabin
of the test plane, enabling them to see the cables that link the
pedals at the pilot's feet with the rudder in the back of the
plane.
<p>
   If the cables do not snap because of the forces applied to them
during the tests, engineers will cut them and measure the sound.
The goal is to try to duplicate sounds captured by the cockpit
voice recorder just before the crash, and to see what effect a
snapped cable might have had on the plane.
<p>
   The investigators are using a plane that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> had removed from
service and is planning to donate to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Flight</ENAMEX>, in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>. The museum is across a runway from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> plant, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> is assisting in the new experiments.
<p>
   The plane that crashed carried an early-model flight data
recorder, which captured only 11 kinds of data. It did not record
the position of the rudder or of the rudder controls. In contrast,
newer data recorders capture dozens of kinds of data, and usually
point investigators toward the root of the problem very quickly.
<p>
   For example, the recorder in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 757 that crashed off the
coast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dominican Republic</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> had 72 kinds of data.
<p>
   Speaking by telephone from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX> as the tests began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> said, ``I just hope the aircraft industry and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal
Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> will take appropriate action so we are
never in a position again where it would take us this much time and
effort.''
<p>
   But the airlines argue that wiring planes to capture more data
would require taking them out of service for long periods, at high
cost.
<p>
   The plane being used for the new tests has been extensively
outfitted with instruments. ``It looks like somebody on life
support,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>, referring to the bundles of wires that are
now attached.
<p>
   Investigators are looking for some combination of problems on
three systems that can move the plane: the main rudder-control
mechanism, a backup mechanism and a yaw damper, which is a
computer-operated automatic system that makes small adjustments in
the rudder to keep the plane's nose and tail lined up in precisely
the direction that the plane is moving.
<p>
   One reason for the new tests is that investigators say they may
not fully understand the significance of an event that occurred
just before the crash: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> plane ran over the wake of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737 flying 4.2 nautical miles ahead.
<p>
   Such wake encounters are common, but investigators think this
one may have put a force on the plane that somehow triggered a
fatal chain of events.

LATEST CRASHES RENEW CONCERNS ABOUT AVIATION SAFETY
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times News Service</ENAMEX> clients.)

<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SEATTLE</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Commercial aviation worldwide is off to a rocky start
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, with two major crashes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX> alone claiming 312
lives.
<p>
   Other forms of transportation aren't faring much better. In the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> alone, railroad accidents have accounted for 19
deaths, 226 injuries and more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$62 million</NUMEX> in damage, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National
Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Hall</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>.
<p>
   And while crashes of airline flights get the most attention,
general aviation is usually deadlier. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> says, 732
people died in general aviation accidents, compared with 175 deaths
from accidents involving scheduled <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> airlines. For the worst
carnage, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s highways are still unrivaled, with 40,000 deaths
reported from motor vehicle accidents each year.
<p>
   Still, news of jet crashes renew questions and concerns about
aviation safety, particularly when it comes in spates and
particularly in a city like <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>, home to the world's biggest
manufacturer of commercial jet aircraft.
<p>
   The crash of a passenger jet anywhere ``is something that
galvanizes attention,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Nance</ENAMEX>, an aviation safety expert
and writer.
<p>
   The latest crash  &MD;  that of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faucett Airlines</ENAMEX>-operated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>
737 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peru</ENAMEX>, which killed 123 aboard  &MD;  came on the heels of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX>
news conference in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> detailing its lack of success
in finding a cause for two <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> crashes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737s, one in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, the other in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Those two crashes are linked by the remaining mystery of the
cause, the fact both involved 737s and the suspicion both crashes
may be linked to a sudden movement of the rudder, sending the
planes into uncontrollable rolls.
<p>
   But there seems to be little commonality in the three most
recent crashes, either by plane type or suspected cause. The crash
of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 757 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombia</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>, which
killed 160 people, occurred as the plane was approaching the
airport; pilot error is suspected.
<p>
   A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 6</TIMEX> crash of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birgen Air</ENAMEX>-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 757 occurred as the
plane was taking off from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dominican Republic</ENAMEX>; that crash
claimed 189 lives. Authorities in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dominican Republic</ENAMEX> say the
recorded air speed indicator at the time the plane stopped climbing
was much higher than what ground radar showed, which would suggest
pilots thought they were going faster  &MD;  and had more power to climb
 &MD;  than they actually did.
<p>
   The investigation has just begun in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peru</ENAMEX> crash, but some
witnesses say the plane was on fire before it hit the ground.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nance</ENAMEX> said there's no apparent common thread running through
those three accidents. ``The only other common denominator (would
be) the human factor, and it's been known for a long time that
human factors account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> of accidents,'' he said.
``It's still the thing that gets us. We're getting better at it,
but we're not as perfect as the machines we build.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> has assisted in the investigation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dominican
Republic</ENAMEX> crash and spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russ Young</ENAMEX> said a team is being sent
to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peru</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Until the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombia</ENAMEX> crash, the 757 hadn't been involved in any
fatal crashes in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 years</TIMEX> of flying. The 737, which in various
models has been in service <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">for 28 years</TIMEX>, is the world's
best-selling commercial aircraft.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> hasn't issued any directives
in relation to the three most recent crashes. ``It's way too early
for that,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Pile</ENAMEX>. ``We would need some kind
of formal finding, unless it was really obvious there was some
problem with the aircraft.''
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Civil Aviation Organization</ENAMEX>
reported, there were 26 accidents involving scheduled aircraft,
resulting in 710 fatalities; that was down from 941 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year
before</TIMEX>.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 6</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> flight 463 was miles
above the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Georgia</ENAMEX> coast when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Krys</ENAMEX> had a heart attack.
<p>
   Nitroglycerine from the plane's medical kit didn't relieve the
passenger's severe chest pains. Yet, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> pilot, instead
of landing, kept the plane on course to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Eight hours later</TIMEX> when the plane landed, the 47-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krys</ENAMEX>
was rushed to a hospital. He survived -- and sued. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</TIMEX> a
federal judge in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> ordered the German airline, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutsche
Lufthansa AG</ENAMEX>, to pay <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krys</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.7 million</NUMEX> for, among other things, its
negligence on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> flight.
<p>
   Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linnea Johnson</ENAMEX> noted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krys</ENAMEX> suffered permanent heart damage
and can expect a shorter life because he was denied prompt medical
care.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Krys</ENAMEX> is a changed man,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> wrote.
<p>
   Such disregard for the health of its passengers isn't just a
public relations nightmare for carriers like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX>. It could
open airlines to the kind of liability they face when a plane
crashes and passengers are killed or hurt.
<p>
   ``This decision may act as the catalyst'' for people to file
similar lawsuits, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Shafran</ENAMEX>, a lawyer specializing in
aviation wrongful death law.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregg Bloche</ENAMEX>, an M.D. and professor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgetown University Law
Center</ENAMEX> agrees. ``Certainly plaintiffs lawyers will pay attention,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloche</ENAMEX> said. ``They are entrepreneurs and it's a well functioning
market.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloche</ENAMEX> said he has been asked to help sick passengers on planes
four times and is ``amazed at how uninformed the flight attendants
seemed.''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> case has prompted some carriers to reexamine
whether their aircraft and crews are equipped to deal with medical
emergencies.
<p>
   ``Airlines may be more inclined to turn around an airliner with
a sick passenger,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia University Law School</ENAMEX> Professor
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Leebron</ENAMEX>, although so-called mercy landings aren't uncommon
now.
<p>
   And as part of a study, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> is
looking at whether airliners needed better medical equipment.
<p>
   Nonetheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Chiames</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Transport Association</ENAMEX>, an
industry trade group, said there is a limit to what airlines can
do. ``Our responsibility isn't to be a flying hospital,'' he said.
<p>
   Critics say the industry can do better. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> requires
airliners to have a first-aid kit on board, as well as a medical
bag with a stethoscope, syringes and other devices. The bag can be
used by a doctor -- if one is on board as a passenger.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Sullivan Garrett</ENAMEX>, founder of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX>-based company that
provides ground-to-air emergency medical advice, says <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> carriers
should train flight attendants in basic medical techniques and
equip planes with emergency oxygen tanks and heart monitors.
<p>
   While <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> airlines defend the current level of medical service,
some foreign carriers are doing more voluntarily.
<p>
   Eventually, lawyers say, if enough airlines install improved
equipment it creates a higher standard for the industry. Airlines
that don't keep up could face liability problems.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sydney</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qantas Airlines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virgin Atlantic Airways</ENAMEX>, the
British carrier, equip their planes with automatic defibrillators.
The devices monitor a heart attack victim and provide a reviving
jolt when needed.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways Plc</ENAMEX> is in the process of installing equipment to
monitor a person's vital signs and send information to a medical
crew on the ground.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qantas</ENAMEX>, which installed defibrillators in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, said they've
been used 50 times and saved two lives.
<p>
   But ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qantas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virgin</ENAMEX> alone can't be considered a standard,''
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Cathcart</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> attorney specializing in
representing victims of air crashes. ``You couldn't say the
standard in the industry is a defibrillator and that if you had one
my father would have lived.''
<p>
   Courts give pilots leeway in making judgments about mercy
landings. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Orient Airlines</ENAMEX> -- now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Airlines Inc.</ENAMEX>
-- was sued in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1980s</TIMEX> after a 66-year-old woman had a heart
attack on a flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Anchorage</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>, and died in a hospital
shortly after reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>. Her relatives said the pilot should
have landed earlier. The court ruled the pilot made a reasonable
decision, given that two doctors on board said the woman's
condition was stable.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> wasn't so lucky. Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> concluded there were
more than enough red flags to warrant an emergency landing. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>
also took <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> to task for not asking ground personnel for
medical advice.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krys</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> travel agent, was flying to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> at the
invitation and expense of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX>. Feeling pains shoot through
his chest and arm, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krys</ENAMEX> began dripping with sweat about 90 minutes
after take-off, said his lawyer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tod Aronovitz</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Soon he was short of breath and was having trouble speaking.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krys</ENAMEX> walked the aisle with his arms raised above his head to ease
the pain. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krys</ENAMEX> went to the plane's galley to lie on the floor,
flight attendants made him return to his seat, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aronovitz</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   A young German gynecologist returning from a vacation gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krys</ENAMEX>
nitroglycerine, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krys</ENAMEX> continued to writhe in pain, according to
court testimony. The gynecologist periodically gave him oxygen.
<p>
   One passenger sitting near <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krys</ENAMEX> testified she put a blanket over
her head so she wouldn't have to watch him die.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX>, which appealed the decision, declined to comment.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krys</ENAMEX>'s son, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Krys</ENAMEX>, flew to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> and stayed with his
father <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">for three weeks</TIMEX> while he recovered in a hospital. But their
nightmare with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> wasn't over.
<p>
   Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Krys</ENAMEX>'s return ticket was on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX>, the father
and son decided to fly home on the carrier. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX>, knowing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krys</ENAMEX>'s medical condition, wouldn't let him on board without a
doctor. So, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Krys</ENAMEX> said, he hired one.
<p>
   ``I expected them to extend a courtesy ticket (for the doctor)
after what had happened,'' the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krys</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   No such luck -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krys</ENAMEX> even had to pay a half-fare for his
father's oxygen tank.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler-Wheelhouse</ENAMEX>, a South African who spent more than 20 years
working for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX>, said the investment had benefited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>,
too. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> has given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> access to a market that car makers crave  &MD; 
affluent, well educated, young and professional  &MD;  a market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> has
failed to entice with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cadillac</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> has also gained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX>'s reputation for technical
expertise, grounded in its origins as an offshoot of a military
aircraft maker. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> now uses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> climate- and emissions-control
systems as well as its engine turbocharging technology. ``We're
small, but we have a great level of technical skill,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler-Wheelhouse</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   That skill was recently shown in a new system that reduces a
car's emissions after a cold start of the engine to well below the
strict standards scheduled to take effect in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several
years</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> have collaborated on a new headrest that
reduces the risk of whiplash in an accident. A mechanical system,
which is activated by any sudden burst of pressure, moves the head
restraint forward to cradle the head before it snaps back.
<p>
   But the most anticipated new product is the car that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX>
intends to introduce <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> for its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50th anniversary</TIMEX>. ``There's
a lot riding on that new car,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> said. ``It's a bad cliche and
a pun, but in this case it's true.''
<p>
   The car is a big secret, but executives do drop a few hints. It
will have sedan and station wagon versions, but, contrary to trade
reports, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler-Wheelhouse</ENAMEX> said it would not replace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX>'s
12-year-old hatchback sedan.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert J.H. McEniry</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> vice president of marketing,
suggested that the new car would aim at a buyer willing to spend
more than the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$32,000</NUMEX> required <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> for a basic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> 900, someone,
perhaps, who would consider buying a 5-series <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMW</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX>
E-class.
<p>
   At a recent auto show in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Geneva</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> displayed two ``concept''
cars, high-performance permutations of the 900 coupe and
convertible. They offered a tantalizing taste of what is likely to
come.
<p>
   Painted in bright, bold colors wrapped around a sleeker, more
solid silhouette and featuring more power, higher torque and an
improved chassis, the cars made their cousins, parked discreetly
off to one side of the exhibit, look like sparrows.
<p>
   But marketing such a car will present several challenges. First,
understatement is a quality admired by typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> buyers, so too
much hype and flash may alienate the customer base.
<p>
   Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> means different things in different markets. In
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, it is linked to its aircraft heritage. But in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United
States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> evokes visions of an absent-minded professor sporting
a tweed jacket and pipe and tooling around in an orange 900 made in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``We started working <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> to bring greater consistency
to the brand worldwide, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald</ENAMEX>-ize it, if you will,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McEniry</ENAMEX>
said. ``We have to give customers security that what they're buying
in the brand is the same no matter where they bought the car.''
<p>
   To that end, the company is using some sales techniques akin to
those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s Saturn division. It recently started offering free
one-hour at-home test drives in some American cities, featuring
delivery of a car by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> technician who will answer questions
but will not make a sale.
<p>
   In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Geneva</ENAMEX>, it is testing a new dealership design whose stark
white walls warmed by cherry wood accents and tile floors evoke an
Italian boutique. After viewing the cars, buyers are ushered behind
a ``confidentiality screen'' to discuss a purchase. Salespeople are
called hosts, and the nearby service center is undergoing a
metamorphosis intended to make the repair experience more personal.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> dealerships are getting more than a face lift, however. In
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, which accounted for more than a quarter of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX>'s sales <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, the company lacks strong dealers in five of
the 11 markets that account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 percent</NUMEX> of the nation's sales of
imported luxury cars, a fact that infuriates <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler-Wheelhouse</ENAMEX>.
``We're weak in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, which is car country,'' he said. ``If
we had the same penetration there that we have in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northeast</ENAMEX>,
we'd be well on our way to achieving our sales goals.''
<p>
   The effort to reach out to the heights of the market runs
counter to the prevailing trends in auto manufacturing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMW</ENAMEX> have both focused their sights lower, increasing their
offerings of smaller, less expensive models in a bid to pump up
sales.
<p>
   But industry experts say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> may have no choice other than to
aim high, since the small-car market is overwhelmed now with bigger
European and Asian competitors.
<p>
   ``Right now, they're caught in the middle,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Spano</ENAMEX>,
who follows the industry for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ludvigsen Associates</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>. ``On
the one side, there's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMW</ENAMEX>, and on the other, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagen</ENAMEX> and the rest. They need to decide which camp they're
going to be in and get out of the middle.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> has clearly elected to take the high road of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMW</ENAMEX>. But that creates a conundrum because the market for
premium-priced cars is minuscule, the very opposite of what is
needed by a company in search of a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> sales increase.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler-Wheelhouse</ENAMEX> reckons on more opportunity there than
elsewhere. People do not want to drive just any car, he says. ``You
don't want your newspaperman delivering your paper in the same
brand of car you drive,'' he said. ``I don't like to criticize my
competitors, but I think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMW</ENAMEX> is starting to have that problem by
reaching too far down to get volume.''
<p>
   As confident as he is in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX>'s strategy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler-Wheelhouse</ENAMEX> is
well aware of how high the hurdle is for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>, it missed
its sales goal of 100,000 cars. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spano</ENAMEX>, the analyst, says European
car makers will be lucky to increase their sales by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 percent to 3
percent</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> falters, it may face the unpleasant prospect of being
taken off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> life-support system. ``There may be a window when
we start thinking about the next new car, when they will pause to
reconsider what they're doing with this company,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler-Wheelhouse</ENAMEX> said. ``We have to make sure they don't have a
reason for doing so.''

LONG-LOST RING RAISES WORLD WAR II GHOST
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.Y. Times News Service</ENAMEX> clients)

<p>
   When a blackened sterling-silver ring popped up like a ghost
from the vintage debris, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Lasher</ENAMEX> was stunned.
<p>
   Poking around with a stick on his hands and knees, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lasher</ENAMEX> wasn't
expecting to uncover much more than a charred piece of radio in the
burned-out remains of a B-17.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Forty-nine years earlier</TIMEX>, the warplane had carried four young
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Army Air Force</ENAMEX> airmen to their deaths on the slopes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San
Francisco Peaks</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flagstaff</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lasher</ENAMEX>, an avid hiker and aviation history buff, spotted
the ring, he could scarcely believe his eyes.
<p>
   ``Mostly what I felt was, well, it was a very humbling moment,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lasher</ENAMEX> said. ``I was a kid during World War II, and I was in awe of
the guys who flew these planes and this ring belonged to one of
those young airman who was alive one minute and dead the next.''
<p>
   Now, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lasher</ENAMEX>, 60, a retired reproduction publishing manager for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlliedSignal Engines</ENAMEX>, wants to track down any family or friends of
the ring's rightful owner.
<p>
   It's not as if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lasher</ENAMEX> doesn't know who the owner was.
<p>
   Through records provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil Air Patrol</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lasher</ENAMEX> knew there had been a crash of a military aircraft at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flagstaff</ENAMEX> site in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX>.
<p>
   In fact, with all the World War II training facilities in and
around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX> area, wreckage is reasonably common in the
mountains of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``They catalog crashes as far back as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lasher</ENAMEX> said,
``giving brief descriptions of the aircraft, the location where it
crashed and when it happened. And in those days, the military
didn't go in and clean up the sites like they do <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.''
<p>
   Starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lasher</ENAMEX> began searching for the
wreckage. After three attempts over several years, he finally found
it.
<p>
   ``I knew a B-17 had crashed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 17, 1944</TIMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bear Jaw Canyon</ENAMEX>
but it's so overgrown that you could walk right past an engine and
not even see it,'' he said.
<p>
   He also knew that the B-17, assigned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kingman Army Air
Field</ENAMEX> nearly 150 miles away, was on a night training flight. First
it was to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Winslow</ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tucson</ENAMEX> and back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kingman</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   On board was Lt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard V. Howell</ENAMEX>, 24, the pilot, from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>;
Lt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard A. Davis</ENAMEX>, 22, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Neb.</ENAMEX>; Flight Warrant Officer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lafayette R. Brown</ENAMEX>, 21, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New London</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>; and Tech. Sgt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund
M. Sikora</ENAMEX>, 26, also of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   It was just at timberline where the bomber hit.
<p>
   ``Kind of a glancing blow,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lasher</ENAMEX> said. ``Another 100 feet
higher and they would have cleared the mountain. They came that
close.''
<p>
   After the plane hit, it broke apart, scattering debris over a
wide area.
<p>
   ``Three of the engines are still there on the ground,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lasher</ENAMEX>
said, ``and the fourth is three or four feet off the ground,
embedded in a tree.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lasher</ENAMEX> said he returned to the crash site three or four times
after locating it and on his second visit, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1993</TIMEX>, he found
the ring.
<p>
   With the help of a friend, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Kropp</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mesa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lasher</ENAMEX> obtained
not only an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> report of the accident but a newspaper story
briefly recounting the crash:
<p>
   ``After passing over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flagstaff</ENAMEX>,'' the report said, ``the
aircraft made a 360 turn around the mountains located north of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flagstaff</ENAMEX>. Shortly after, two fires broke out in the aircraft and a
minute later, another fire broke out at the rear of the aircraft.
The B-17 glided towards the earth. It hit the tops of trees at the
top of the peak, separating the tail assembly from the main part of
the airplane. The wreckage was completely burned. There were no
survivors.''
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 23, 1944</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Arizona Republic</ENAMEX> reported: ``The bodies
of four airmen removed from a B-17 bomber, which crashed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>
near the top of 12,000 foot <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco peaks</ENAMEX>, were brought out
of the wilderness to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kingman Army Airfield</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.... A military
party reached the ship's burned wreckage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last night</TIMEX>.''
<p>
   Once <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lasher</ENAMEX> unearthed the ring and wiped the years of soot and
dirt from it, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cottonwood</ENAMEX> man found the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAAF</ENAMEX>'s ``wings and
propeller'' insignia along with an eagle perched over sergeant's
chevrons.
<p>
   ``When I found out that this was an enlisted man's ring, I knew
who it belonged to,'' Lasher said. ``It had to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Sikora</ENAMEX>'s,
the flight engineer or crew chief for that aircraft because he was
the only enlisted man aboard.''
<p>
   Checking further, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lasher</ENAMEX> discovered that young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sikora</ENAMEX> was
unmarried and had listed his mother, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josephine Sikora</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> as
his next of kin.
<p>
   Searching a phone book, Lasher has found nearly 30 listings with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sikora</ENAMEX> surname.
<p>
   And now with more time on his hands, because of his recent
retirement, he intends to contact them.
<p>
   ``If I can find a relative of his that's still living, and they
have an interest,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lasher</ENAMEX> said, ``I'd like to present the ring to
them.''
<p>
   For the moment, the silver ring rests in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lasher</ENAMEX>'s jewelry box,
while a piece of the bomber's tail section sits in his yard.
<p>
   And if he fails to locate a suitable recipient in the next few
months, he'll loan the ring and the tailpiece to a new museum in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kingman</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``At least that way,'' he said, ``a part of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Sikora</ENAMEX> will
finally get back to where he was trying to go.''

<p>
   The Russian airline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> has been hit with a writ for loss
and damages, filed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> by the families of seven passengers
killed in an air crash.
<p>
   All 75 people on board the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> Airbus died when it ploughed
into a Siberian mountain in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1994</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> general manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vassili Tkatchenko</ENAMEX> said
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> he was unaware the writ had been filed.
<p>
   The writ is for ``damages, interest and costs'' of seven
passengers who died when the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airbus</ENAMEX> A310 flight bound for
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> crashed at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Novokuznetsk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Siberia</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   It claims the deaths were ``caused by negligence, breach of
statutory duty and breach of contract on the part of the defendant
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX>].''
<p>
   Air industry investigators say the 15-year-old son of Captain
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yaroslav Kudrinsky</ENAMEX> was flying the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>-bound aircraft after it
left <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>. Black box transcripts show <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eldar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yana</ENAMEX>, his
13-year-old sister, were in the cockpit prior to the crash.
<p>
   Airline passengers are protected under a section of the Warsaw
Convention relating to air travel which was signed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 12,
1929</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The liability of the carrier for death or personal injury to
passengers has an upper limit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$75,000</NUMEX>. But larger amounts have
been awarded through the courts or through out-of-court
settlements.
<p>
   Aviation consultant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Miller</ENAMEX>, the managing director of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinity Aviation</ENAMEX>, said he was unaware of any aviation court
settlements in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``Taking it to the courts is very unusual for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>,'' Mr
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Six of the claims in the writs were filed by family members who
live outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WAREHAM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Four people, including a 4-year-old girl and
her mother, were killed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> when a single-engine airplane
trying to make an emergency landing touched down onto <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Interstate
495</ENAMEX> and collided head-on with a station wagon, officials said.
<p>
   The two people in the plane, who were not identified, and the
two passengers in the car  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen Wilkinson</ENAMEX>, 22, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Framingham</ENAMEX> and
her daughter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brittany Karp</ENAMEX>  &MD;  died in the fiery crash, officials
said. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilkinson</ENAMEX> was taken by ambulance to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tobey Hospital</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wareham</ENAMEX>, where she died a short time later, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia Outhouse</ENAMEX>,
a hospital spokeswoman.
<p>
   Her daughter apparently died at the scene of the accident, which
occurred at about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:45 p.m.</TIMEX>
<p>
   The driver of the car, 31-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Lobello</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wayland</ENAMEX>,
suffered head injuries and was evaluated at the hospital before
being airlifted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brigham and Women's Hospital</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late
Saturday afternoon</TIMEX>. He was in stable condition.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Police</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> that they were still trying to
identify the pilot and passenger in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piper</ENAMEX> Arrow plane, who
apparently died instantly when the aircraft exploded on impact.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lobello</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilkinson</ENAMEX> were driving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brittany</ENAMEX> back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mashpee</ENAMEX>
home of her father, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwin (Rusty) Karp</ENAMEX>, after spending the week
with her, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karp</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brittany</ENAMEX> lived with her father, who
dated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilkinson</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">for three years</TIMEX>, he said.
<p>
   ``This is the hardest day of my life,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karp</ENAMEX> said. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brittany</ENAMEX>
was the best little thing in the world. She was my life. I'm just
trying now to survive.''
<p>
   Of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilkinson</ENAMEX>, a pharmacy technician at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVS</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Framingham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karp</ENAMEX>
said, ``She loved <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brittany</ENAMEX> very much. She had a great sense of
humor.''
<p>
   At about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:45 p.m.</TIMEX> the plane, apparently with the engine not
working, slashed a tree next to the highway, bounced on the
northbound lane and swerved across the median, officials said. The
plane hit the white <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> station wagon as it traveled south.
<p>
   ``It was unbelievable  &MD;  there were just flames and smoke
everywhere,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddie Caprarella</ENAMEX>, who was driving by.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Monteiro</ENAMEX>, who lives near the crash site just over the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middleborough</ENAMEX> town line, said he was washing his car when he heard
the falling plane hit the highway and saw it lurch left, right and
left again. Then there were two loud crashes and an explosion that
sent flames shooting as high as 80 feet into the air, he said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monteiro</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lobello</ENAMEX> got out of the car in a daze and was
pleading with other drivers to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilkinson</ENAMEX>, crying out: ``She's
choking! She's choking!''
<p>
   ``Definitely there was panic,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monteiro</ENAMEX> said. ``People on the
highway were just shocked.''
<p>
   Police and aviation authorities had not determined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> the
plane's point of origin or its intended destination. But a
spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">T.F. Green
State Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warwick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">R.I.</ENAMEX>, said that the tower there had
received an emergency distress call from the plane saying that it
was having engine trouble.
<p>
   Controllers there tried to guide the plane to the nearest
airport, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Bedford</ENAMEX>, but the pilot apparently attempted an
emergency landing either on the highway or in a bog next to it,
officials said.
<p>
   The plane was a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX> model, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merrill Cross</ENAMEX>, an investigator
on the scene from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX>. An
investigator from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> was en
route from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, a spokesman from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   About a dozen grieving relatives of the victims arrived at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tobey
Hospital</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> in shock.
<p>
   When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilkinson</ENAMEX>'s mother was told of the deaths of her daughter
and granddaughter by relatives outside the emergency room, she
collapsed instantly, wailing in agony.
<p>
   An aunt of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brittany</ENAMEX>'s said, ``She was like a little flower that
was still blooming.''
<p>
   At the crash scene <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, where rescue crews continued the
grisly job of exploring the wreckage while traffic throughout the
region came to a halt, the twisted, burnt-out frame of the plane
lay stretched across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Interstate 495</ENAMEX>. Only its wings, burnt to the
core, were recognizable.
<p>
   The station wagon, which had taken the most impact, was some 30
yards away, an empty baby seat in the front passenger side. A
child's bicycle appeared to have fallen out of the car and leaned
up against one side.
<p>
   State Trooper <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Serpa</ENAMEX>, the first trooper to arrive on the
scene, said the carnage left rescue crews shaken. ``It was a very
traumatic experience,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serpa</ENAMEX> said. ``It wasn't something I'd want
to see every day.''
<p>
   Given the way in which the plane descended and swerved across a
major highway, it was amazing that more people were not hurt or
killed in the crash, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Police</ENAMEX> Lt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed Mustafa</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   ``Maybe everyone was already down at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape</ENAMEX>,'' he said,
alluding to the light <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> traffic on one of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>'s first
balmy days. ``Or maybe it was just a fluke.''

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">BOSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  In era of corporate downsizing and labor-management
wars, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam and Jim Snyder</ENAMEX> were the kind of bosses workers dream of.
<p>
   At the brothers' plastics firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, all 85
employees worked full time, for full benefits, and a pay scale they

flying crash-landed into a station wagon on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Route 495</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wareham</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Snyder</ENAMEX>, 50, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Snyder</ENAMEX>, 49, were killed, along with
a 4-year-old girl, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brittany Wilkinson-Karp</ENAMEX>, and her 23-year-old
mother, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen Wilkinson</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Investigators who examined the wreckage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> said they were
focusing on mechanical failure as the cause of the crash. They also
said it appears that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Snyder</ENAMEX> acted appropriately in trying to
emergency-land the plane, which was having engine trouble. A
preliminary report may be available from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National
Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">within several days</TIMEX>, but a final report
is expected to take much longer.
<p>
   Meanwhile, families, friends and employees are left to take
stock in the wake of the sudden loss of four lives.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snyders</ENAMEX> had worked together since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>, when a coin toss
made <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX> president and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX> vice president of their new firm. They
had grown up together, and socialized together. But though both
loved to fly, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>'s ill-fated outing in a rented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piper</ENAMEX> Arrow
was the first time the brothers had flown together.
<p>
   ``They were a great team,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Esterman</ENAMEX>, a machinist
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polymer Design</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">for five years</TIMEX>. ``They were always walking around
the factory, telling us how important we were to the company.
Everyone should have bosses like that.''
<p>
   Investigators believe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Snyder</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, flew from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norwood Memorial Airport</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Plymouth Airport</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> to
pick up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hingham</ENAMEX> resident. The brothers then took off again,
headed to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Block Island</ENAMEX>, off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rhode Island</ENAMEX>, investigators said.
<p>
   An air traffic control tower in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warwick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">R.I.</ENAMEX>, received the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snyders</ENAMEX>' emergency distress call reporting engine trouble shortly
before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:45 p.m.</TIMEX> The tower tried to guide the aircraft, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>
model owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADS Flight Center</ENAMEX>, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Bedford</ENAMEX> airport.
<p>
   Minutes later, the plane bounced onto <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Route 495</ENAMEX>, swerved across
the median and crashed into a white Chevrolet Celebrity station
wagon heading south, about a mile south of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Exit 2</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snyders</ENAMEX> were
trying to make an emergency landing, either on the road or in a
nearby cranberry bog.
<p>
   The plane exploded on impact, killing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snyders</ENAMEX> and little
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brittany</ENAMEX> instantly, officials said. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilkinson</ENAMEX>, who worked at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVS</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Framingham</ENAMEX>, died on the way to the hospital. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brittany</ENAMEX> was
supposed to attend a birthday party <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that afternoon</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADS Flight Center</ENAMEX> declined to comment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The only survivor of the crash was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Lobello</ENAMEX>, the driver
of the station wagon. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lobello</ENAMEX>, 31, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wayland</ENAMEX>, an unemployed auto
mechanic who had dated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilkinson</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">for several years</TIMEX>, was in stable
condition <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brigham and Women's Hospital</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``He has no broken bones, only a broken heart,'' said his
mother, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie Lobello</ENAMEX>. ``He feels like he should be dead, too. He
keeps saying, `They're dead, I should be dead.' ''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lobello</ENAMEX> told his family the plane swooped into his path out of
nowhere, giving him no chance to swerve out of the way. Witnesses
said the plane's engine appeared to be stalled and that its
propeller had stopped spinning.
<p>
   ``It was too quick, too fast  &MD;  there was nothing he could do,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie Lobello</ENAMEX> said. ``He heard people screaming that they were on
fire, but he couldn't do anything. It was all in flames, it was
just too quick.''
<p>
   Friends and neighbors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snyders</ENAMEX>, who both were married with
children, said the brothers were avid and reliable pilots. They
said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX> had considered a career in aviation, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX>
also knew what he was doing.
<p>
   ``He loved flying, and he was very good at it,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew
Melton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Snyder</ENAMEX>'s neighbor in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newton</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   For the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snyders</ENAMEX>, the fiery explosion ended a remarkable
entrepreneurial success story. Both were trained as engineers  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX>
at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Naval Academy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeastern
University</ENAMEX>  &MD;  but found their calling in the business world,
parlaying their technical knowledge about liquid resins into an
international moneymaker.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Over 17 years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polymer Design Corp.</ENAMEX> carved a niche as a reliable
source for small but complex orders of custom-made plastic parts.
It supplies medical firms with arthro-scopes, heart pumps and
high-tech devices for spinal surgery. It makes protective suits for
helicopter crews and bomb disposal squads. It once replicated a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950s</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cadillac</ENAMEX> tail fin for a customer.
<p>
   With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Snyder</ENAMEX> overseeing the engineers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Snyder</ENAMEX> in
charge of sales and administration, the firm has earned a
reputation as a pioneer in its field. It has grown almost every
year, and added 13,000 square feet of factory space at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">start of
this decade</TIMEX>.
<p>
   But the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pleasant Street</ENAMEX> company is also known as a solid
corporate citizen. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snyders</ENAMEX> donated a used machine-shop
lathe to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockland High School</ENAMEX> shop department, saving the
cash-strapped school an estimated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30,000</NUMEX>.
<p>
   ``They were really unique,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Salto</ENAMEX>, an engineer at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polymer Design</ENAMEX>. ``I'll tell you, they always listened to what we
had to say, even if we disagreed with them. They always treated all
of us with respect. I just can't say enough about them.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polymer Design</ENAMEX> is a private firm, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snyders</ENAMEX> regularly
opened their books to their employees. They also invited workers to
suggest pay structures that would reward teamwork and customer
service. And they often footed the bill for company outings, trying
to foster a sense of camaraderie and pride.
<p>
   There is no union at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polymer Design</ENAMEX>, but every employee works
full-time, with health insurance and a 401K plan. Workers say it is
no accident that most of them have stayed with the company for
years.
<p>
   ``People just don't leave,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Esterman</ENAMEX> said. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX> were
tough businessmen, but they made sure we were all happy.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Snyder</ENAMEX> leaves his wife, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marshfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, schoolteacher,
and three children. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Snyder</ENAMEX> leaves his wife and two children.
<p>
   Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rusty Karp</ENAMEX> was preparing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> to bury his daughter
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brittany</ENAMEX> next to her mother. The girl spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> at
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilkinson</ENAMEX>'s home in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Framingham</ENAMEX>, and was to have returned home
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karp</ENAMEX>'s home on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape</ENAMEX>, where she has lived <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">for
the past three years</TIMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brittany</ENAMEX> had been ill, so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karp</ENAMEX> agreed to
let <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilkinson</ENAMEX> bring her back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, as long as she returned in
time for a friend's birthday party.
<p>
   ``His whole life is dwindling,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karp</ENAMEX>'s sister, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Jane
Dyer</ENAMEX>. ``She was the center of his life, she was his everything.''
<p>
   A funeral will be held for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen Wilkinson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brittany
Wilkinson-Karp</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Snyder</ENAMEX>'s funeral will be held
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>. Funeral arrangements for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Snyder</ENAMEX> were incomplete.

TWO PRIOR CRASHES OF 737S STILL UNSOLVED
(With CRASH-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BROWN</ENAMEX>-NYT)

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> plane that crashed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Croatia</ENAMEX> on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> was a modified version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737, a widely used
aircraft with one of the best safety records in the air. But two
unexplained crashes in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last five years</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX>, have raised questions about the 737's
performance.
<p>
   Like the plane that crashed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, those aircraft crashed
while approaching airports for landing. But it is not known if
there are any similarities between the crashes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>
and the crash in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Croatia</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The investigators in the crash on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> may be lacking one
basic tool available to those probing the civilian crashes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air
Force</ENAMEX> public affairs office at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> said that the plane,
like many of its aircraft, did not carry a cockpit voice recorder
or a flight data recorder, which are commonly known as black boxes.
However, a spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. European Command</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stuttgart</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, contradicted that, saying such equipment was aboard.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> crash, of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> that
crashed on an airport approach in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, is the most intensively
studied crash in the history of American civil aviation, but safety
experts still do not know what caused it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX>
crash, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, is also unexplained; transportation officials hope
the investigation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> crash will help explain it.
<p>
   The 737 is the single most popular commercial jet, and it makes
up about a quarter of the American airline jet fleet. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> has
sold over 1,100 of the 737-200s, the model that crashed on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, and over 2,800 of all types of 737s, with 500 more on
order.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> bought 19, including the one that crashed on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5.4 million</NUMEX> each, and they were delivered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>
and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>. Most are used for training navigators. Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> had never had a crash involving the planes, or indeed
any incident that resulted in a death or permanent disability.
<p>
   The plane that crashed had recorded 12,000 landings and 17,000
hours of flight, which made it a relatively young aircraft, said
Maj. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura J. Feldman</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>. The plane was
flying from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tuzla</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX>, a 45-minute trip.
<p>
   Among the characteristics that make the 737 desirable for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> is its ability to operate from short, rough airfields.
<p>
   The plane that crashed, called a T-43 by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>, was set
up to carry about 60 passengers. It had fewer windows than the
airline model and some extra electronic equipment protruding from
its stubby, 100-foot-long body.
<p>
   The plane had been used in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosnia</ENAMEX> in recent weeks to ferry
American and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> dignitaries to and from airports where many
runways have been scarred by civil war. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> officials say
that Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Christopher</ENAMEX> flew aboard the plane
during a visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The plane had been used <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this week</TIMEX> to ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX>
Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Perry</ENAMEX> on trips within the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX>  &MD;  from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zagreb</ENAMEX>,
the Croatian capital, to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tuzla</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sarajevo</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosnia</ENAMEX>, and then to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tirana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Albania</ENAMEX>, and from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Albania</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cairo</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>. Military
officials said that the plane then returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zagreb</ENAMEX> to pick up
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Brown</ENAMEX> and his delegation.
<p>
   For security, the crew minimized time at low altitudes, to limit
the possibility of the plane being hit by gunfire or shells fired
by rebel forces, according to officials.
<p>
   The plane, clearly marked with a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> flag on its tail and the
bold lettering ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States of America</ENAMEX>'' on its side, was based
at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ramstein Air Base</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, as was its crew. The civilian
version has a crew of three; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> said that the plane that
crashed had six crewmen on board.
<p>
   Investigators working on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> crash say they believe
that the aircraft's trajectory on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> can be explained only
by a sudden, full swing of the rudder on its tail, but the parts
that survived the wreckage do not provide any physical evidence
that this actually occurred, and the flight data recorder was not
sophisticated enough to record the information.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>, the independent
federal agency in charge of investigating civilian aircraft
accidents, hopes to finish the investigation and reach a conclusion
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Apart from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>, the agency has only
three unsolved crashes in its 29-year history.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safety Board</ENAMEX> is sending several investigators with the
military team to look into the crash.

PLANE'S CRASH AGAIN RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS CIVILIAN COUSIN, THE
737
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times News Service</ENAMEX> clients.)

<p>
   The jet that crashed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Commerce</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron
Brown</ENAMEX> and 32 others aboard was a military derivative of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>
737  &MD;  similar in many ways to the civilian model but different in
that it had no in-flight voice or data recorders.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> sold 19 of the T-43 models to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973-74</TIMEX> for use as trainers. A couple, like the one that crashed
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, were later refitted to carry passengers.
<p>
   The T-43 is basically a 737-200 model with a reinforced floor to
support training equipment and with fewer windows. Most of the
fleet is involved in training flight navigators for other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
military aircraft, stationed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> bases around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United
States</ENAMEX>. The plane that crashed was stationed at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ramstein Air Force
Base</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">76th Airlift Squadron</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The tragedy again raises questions about the 737, if only
because the well-traveled jetliner has been involved in a pair of
unsolved crashes in recent years. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 3, 1991</TIMEX>, crash of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> 737 near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX> killed 25 people. The
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 8, 1994</TIMEX>, crash of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> 737 near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alequippa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, in which
132 people died, remains under investigation.
<p>
   In both accidents, the aircraft rolled sharply and crashed.
Federal investigations into the crashes have centered on
unexplained movements of the rudder. About a dozen such incidents,
not involving crashes, have been recorded on 737 flights.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Air Force</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> representatives said they have no
immediate explanations for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>'s crash in the coastal
mountains of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Croatia</ENAMEX>. The 22-year-old aircraft had modern safety
equipment and was certified for instrument flying in the type of
stormy weather reported in the area at the time of the crash.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russ Young</ENAMEX> said the company will send experts
to support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>'s investigation of the crash.
<p>
   That investigation will be hampered by the T-43's lack of the
``black box'' recorders that are standard equipment on commercial
jets. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> Maj. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felicity Tavares</ENAMEX> said the T-43 was equipped
only with a ground-proximity warning system and standard commercial
navigational aids.
<p>
   The airplane had logged about 17,000 hours of flying time and
had 12,000 take-off and landing cycles. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> officials say that's
not much by normal commercial standards, and especially not for a
737, which is designed for frequent, short-haul service.
<p>
   Aerospace industry officials say the crash underscores the
challenge facing modern aviation, to reduce the number of crashes
even as the number of flights increases.
<p>
   The challenge is particularly acute for the 737. With more than
2,600 jets in service and more than 3,300 ordered, the 737 is the
world's best-selling jetliner. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> executives and many observers
argue that, considering its tremendous number of flights in all
conditions, the 737 is as safe as any aircraft.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Neale</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Transport Association</ENAMEX>, which represents
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> airlines, said that the incidence of accidents has fallen by
half <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over the past 15 years</TIMEX>. But the rising number of flights makes
it sometimes appear that the chance of a crash is increasing.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1979 to 1994</TIMEX>, the number of fatal accidents was 1 per 1.8
million flights, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neale</ENAMEX> said, vs. 1 per 814,000 flights <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1963 to
1978</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Robeson</ENAMEX>, vice president of civil aviation for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aerospace
Industries Association</ENAMEX>, a manufacturers' group, said the
improvements have flowed from advancements in technology as well as
training.
<p>
   ``Controlled flight into terrain'' was a leading cause of
crashes until the advent of the ground-proximity warning system,
which tells pilots when they're too close to the ground, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robeson</ENAMEX>
said.
<p>
   ``Human factors''  &MD;  such as improved training, improved
flight-deck design and improved maintenance  &MD;  also have played a
large role in improving safety, he said.
<p>
   Still, the severity of air crashes, no matter how rare, makes
the safety issue one of constant concern. Industry officials
acknowledge that if the public doesn't think it's safe to fly,
they'll be out of business.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald H. Brown</ENAMEX> and 32 others
are missing and believed dead after a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Air Force</ENAMEX> jetliner
carrying them from the Bosnian city of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tuzla</ENAMEX> to the Croatian port
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX> crashed in bad weather <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The plane hit a hillside 1.8 miles from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX> airport as it
prepared to land in poor visibility, Lt. Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howell M. Estes</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs of Staff</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>. Croatian special police
had made their way up to the remote, cloud-covered site, Estes
said, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> troops were on the way.
<p>
   Unconfirmed reports from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX> included accounts of rescue
teams finding several bodies and one person, a woman, alive. The
woman was later reported to have died of her injuries on the way to
a local hospital. ``We have no confirmed reports of either
fatalities or survivors,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Estes</ENAMEX> said, although officials said they
were pessimistic.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> would be the first serving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabinet</ENAMEX> officer to die in the
line of duty in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="150 years">more than 150 years</TIMEX>. The plane was also carrying a
delegation of senior American business executives.
<p>
   Officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> appeared inclined to blame the weather
for the crash. They said there was no indication of hostile fire or
a suspicious explosion.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> was ``one of the best advisers and ablest people I ever
knew,'' President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> told staff at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> when it became clear that little hope remained
of finding any survivors.
<p>
   A consummate Washington insider and former staff director for
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward M. Kennedy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> had been chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democratic
Party</ENAMEX> before becoming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> secretary in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>.
<p>
   He was traveling in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX> with senior executives from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX>
corporations in an effort to involve <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> business in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX>,
and particularly in the postwar reconstruction of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosnia</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Earlier
in the day</TIMEX>, he had spent time with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> troops in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tuzla</ENAMEX>, regaling
them with Big Macs and tapes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCAA</ENAMEX> basketball finals.
<p>
   Other passengers on the plane are thought to include members of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s staff, senior officials of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy</ENAMEX>
departments, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathaniel Nash</ENAMEX>, a correspondent from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York
Times</ENAMEX>. Six of the missing are believed to have been the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>
crew members of the T-43 aircraft, the military version of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>
737.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Rodham
Clinton</ENAMEX> visited <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alma</ENAMEX>, and son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX>, for 50 minutes
at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Browns</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> townhouse. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s daughter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tracey</ENAMEX>, was
flying in from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   After the visit, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clintons</ENAMEX> and members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabinet</ENAMEX> went to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> addressed staff members, many of
whom wept.
<p>
   ``We do not know for sure what happened there,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> said,
referring to the crash. But he paid tribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>, describing
him as ``a magnificent life force.''
<p>
   ``He was one of the best advisers and ablest people I ever knew.
And he was very, very good at everything he ever did. Whether he
was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commerce</ENAMEX> secretary or a civil rights leader or something else,
he was always out there just giving it his all,'' he said.
<p>
   ``This is a man whose multiple talents will not be easily
replaced,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eleanor Holmes Norton</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">District of Columbia</ENAMEX>'s
delegate to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. ``For the African-American community, the
loss is into infinity.''
<p>
   After visiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> home <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>
issued a statement saying, ``At a time of increasing polarization
and heightened voices and more intense rhetoric, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron</ENAMEX> cut to the
core of an issue and was able to reconcile different viewpoints in
a way that established common ground. We need those talents much
more as a country.''
<p>
   Fears for the plane began to surface in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late
Wednesday morning</TIMEX>. Well over three hours after the plane had been
due to land, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> put out a terse statement saying that
it was missing. By then, night was beginning to fall in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Croatia</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   For a number of hours, the fact that the plane was missing was
the only confirmed piece of information. Confusion reigned, with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX>
and Croatian officials offering differing locations for the crash
site.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> officials spoke of wreckage being seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Adriatic Sea</ENAMEX>
off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX>, while Croatian officials, including President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franjo
Tudjman</ENAMEX>, said the plane had crashed into a mountainside near the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX> airport.
<p>
   Planes and helicopters searched the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Adriatic</ENAMEX> for signs of a
crash. But the Croatians, whose troops were scouring the mountains
around the airport, proved to be right. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Later in the day</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Estes</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs of Staff</ENAMEX> pieced together the chronology of the
tragedy at a press briefing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s plane had left <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tuzla</ENAMEX>, the northern Bosnian city that is
the headquarters of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> military operations in the country, around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2
p.m. local time</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7 a.m. EST</TIMEX>). The flight should have taken about 45
minutes.
<p>
   Because of bad weather around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX>, the pilots used an
instrument approach, a standard procedure in poor weather, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Estes</ENAMEX>
said. The plane was in contact with the control tower in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX>
when communications were suddenly lost at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:52 p.m. Croatian time</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The plane crashed into the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St John's Hill</ENAMEX>, a 2,300-foot
hill about 1.8 miles northwest of the airport, he said. Officials
noted that the crash site put the plane well off course.
<p>
   The T-43, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ramstein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, had been used to transport
a number of VIPs around the region, officials said, including
Defense Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willian Perry</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clintons</ENAMEX>' daughter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chelsea</ENAMEX>. It had undergone a ``total''
maintenance and inspection in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1995</TIMEX> and run up a total of about
17,000 flying hours, a relatively modest amount, he said.
<p>
   Bad weather had not hindered other planes landing at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX>
airport <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tudjman</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX> that three aircraft  &MD;  two
Croatian and one Swiss  &MD;  had landed there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="``half an hour'' before">``half an hour'' before
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s plane was due to arrive</TIMEX>.
<p>
    &UR; el.5l &LR; 
<p>
   But conditions remained so bad that a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> military helicopter was
unable to land near the crash site and had to return to the
airport.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Air Force</ENAMEX> appointed Brig. Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Coolidge</ENAMEX> to lead
an inquiry into the crash. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coolidge</ENAMEX> was to leave for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last
night</TIMEX>, and will be assisted by members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National
Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Officials said the plane lacked a flight recorder, which might
have helped determine the cause of the crash.
<p>
   Investigators will almost certainly be able to use less
conventional sources of information. These could include AWACS, or
airborne warning and control systems, aircraft and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National
Security Agency</ENAMEX>, the secretive communications intelligence
organization that is reported to be very active in monitoring the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX> peace process.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Working in foul weather and hampered by the hazard
of mines, search parties on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saint John's Hill</ENAMEX> just outside
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Croatia</ENAMEX>, recovered the remains of 33 people <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>
from the wreckage of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Air Force</ENAMEX> jet. Among them was the body of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald H. Brown</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> and his colleagues died on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> when their plane,
flying in heavy rain and near-zero visibility, apparently went off
course and crashed into the hillside, nearly 2 miles northwest of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX> airport. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> was flying to the Croatian port city for
talks with government ministers after visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> troops in the
northern Bosnian city of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tuzla</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   As investigators arrived to search for the causes of the
accident and military mortuary teams started work, confusion
remained on a number of key issues. Why was the plane off course?
Were there 33 people on board or 35, as a manifest released by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">State Department</ENAMEX> indicated? Did the plane have a voice recorder and
so-called black box and if not, why not?
<p>
   Two things were clear, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> Ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Croatia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Galbraith</ENAMEX>
said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX> after he visited the crash site. One was
that the weather was terrible: ``In fact, people in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX> said
this is the worst storm in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX>.''
<p>
   The other was that the plane ``was not where is should have
been.'' Instead of approaching the airport from the sea, it was
flying up a valley ``one ridge over'' from the airport, he said.
<p>
   Officials do, however, seem to be increasingly confident that
the plane was not attacked by renegade soldiers from any of the
armies operating in the region.
<p>
   While the area had once been on the front lines in the war
between Croat and Serb armies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Perry</ENAMEX> said
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that potentially hostile forces were no longer in the
area. And, he added, ``you cannot direct ground fire against an
airplane if you can't see it.'' Visibility in the area was so bad
at the time of the crash, he said, that ``directing small arms fire
or directing a shoulder-fired rocket at the airplane would have
been almost impossible.''
<p>
   But, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perry</ENAMEX> added, it would take ``some days'' for investigators
to determine exactly what happened. Officials have declined to
speculate about the causes of the crash. But a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX>
official said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, ``The most likely hypotheses are serious
pilot error or serious equipment malfunction.''
<p>
   In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> ordered all flags on
official buildings to be flown at half-staff until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 10</TIMEX>. After
a private memorial service at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St John's Church</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, a
short distance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> once again paid
tribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>, his government colleagues, the business
executives and others who died with him.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s spokesman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael McCurry</ENAMEX>, described the president as
``in a very somber mood.''
<p>
   No date has yet been announced either for a funeral or for the
return of the bodies. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s family was to gather <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> to
discuss the funeral arrangements, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCurry</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Earlier Thursday morning</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> said, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> broke
the news to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alma Brown</ENAMEX> that her husband's body had been identified
by Brig. Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Canavan</ENAMEX>, the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> military officer on the
scene.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perry</ENAMEX>, reflecting on the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> and of Deputy Assistant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Kruzel</ENAMEX>  &MD;  killed in an accident outside
Sarajevo, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosnia-Herzegovina</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>  &MD;  said the tragedies
illustrated the risks involved in operations such as the one in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosnia</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   But, he told journalists, ``I believe our security interests are
worth risks.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perry</ENAMEX> noted that he had in fact flown to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Egypt</ENAMEX> in
the same plane the day before it returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> to collect
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late Thursday</TIMEX>, remains of 14 people had been removed from the
crash site and taken to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   An internal government memo described the scene at the crash
site. The memo said that the aircraft, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>-made T-43, was
lying in pieces, with fragments spread over a radius of 400 meters.
The plane showed some signs of fire, but there were no indications
that it had been struck by a projectile. The bodies were thrown
clear of the plane.
<p>
   Heavy rain, high winds, fog and wind chills in the low 30s
continued to make the retrieval work difficult. The bad weather, in
fact, seems to have played a role in diverting investigators flying
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vicenza</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> mortuary team has
arrived at the scene, and additional staff is on its way from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort
Lee</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Croatian officials at the site continued to insist that black
boxes  &MD;  voice and data recorders built to withstand a crash and
help explain its causes  &MD;  had been found at the site.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Estes</ENAMEX> disputed this. ``The information we have is that this
aircraft was not equipped with what you would consider black
boxes,'' he said. Searchers may have recovered instruments in black
boxes, he said. But real black boxes are in fact colored bright
orange, to facilitate their retrieval.
<p>
   The T-43 is the military equivalent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737. Most of
the 19 purchased by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> have been used to train aviators
in navigation.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Estes</ENAMEX> attributed the lack of a black box to the fact that the
plane had been acquired originally as a training aircraft.

NEW PRESSURES ON AIRLINE CRASH-LIABILITY ACCORD
(lh)
By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MATTHEW L. WALD</ENAMEX>
c.<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.Y. Times News Service</ENAMEX>

<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The Warsaw Convention governing the liability of an
airline when passengers die in a plane crash is crumbling as
airlines try to raise the accord's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$75,000</NUMEX> limit on damages.
<p>
   But prospects for a new agreement are uncertain, because the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Department of Transportation</ENAMEX> is demanding that the accord
provide that damage suits involving Americans be heard in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>. Some foreign airlines reject that demand.
<p>
   This is the third effort to raise the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$75,000</NUMEX> limit, which was
set in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX> and which all parties agree is now far too low. Efforts
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> would have raised the limit several-fold and were
eagerly supported by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> did not
approve them. Trial lawyers said the higher limits were still too
low, and aircraft manufacturers feared high limits would encourage
suits against them.
<p>
   ``The amount of time it's taking to do something rational is
simply astonishing,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey N. Shane</ENAMEX>, an aviation lawyer who
was assistant secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transportation</ENAMEX> for policy and
international affairs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1989 to 1993</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The Warsaw Convention, initiated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX> among 29 countries and
joined by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1934</TIMEX>, also governs who may sue and
where, and details cargo rules. All nations with commercial
airlines have signed on, but the airlines agree that the document
needs to be updated.
<p>
   Because of the low liability limit, many airlines are
voluntarily paying more, either to spare themselves a lengthy trial
at which families will try to show negligence  &MD;  which allows higher
damages  &MD;  or for general good will, or because they do not think
the limits will hold up in court.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>, for example, has told families of the people
who died when one of its planes crashed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombia</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>
that it would negotiate as if the limit did not exist; it is doing
the same for the 16 passengers on international trips who were on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Eagle</ENAMEX> commuter flight that crashed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Roselawn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ind.</ENAMEX>,
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1994</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``The message <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> is sending is, `We'll do what's fair,
because we know a jury will do what's fairer,''' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Lambert
Harris</ENAMEX>, who was an acting administrator of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation
Administration</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration.
<p>
   But the airlines would like a realistic limit and uniform
system. Representatives of airlines from around the world met <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this
week</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montreal</ENAMEX> to try to work out the details of a system with no
limits. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> airlines have received an antitrust exemption to
negotiate an agreement, which would be subject to government
approval.
<p>
   The airlines and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials envision fairly simple
negotiations with families over ``economic damages,'' the amount
that the victim was likely to have earned over the remaining years
of his or her life, given normal life expectancy. The sticking
point now is which court would resolve disputes if negotiations
failed.
<p>
   Under the current agreement, survivors can bring suit in the
country the plane was flying to, the home country of the airline, a
country where the airline has its major operation or the country
where the contract for transportation was written.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> wants a ``fifth jurisdiction'' for Americans:
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>. Since domestic carriers are based here, they can
already be sued here; adding the ``fifth jurisdiction'' would
generally affect overseas carriers.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">DUBROVNIK</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Croatia</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The coffins carrying the remains of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Brown</ENAMEX> and 32 other Americans killed in a
plane crash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> were loaded onto two C-17 transport planes
that took off for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dover Air Force Base</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</ENAMEX> after a somber
farewell ceremony in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Croatian and American officials, flanked by 19 American and 19
Croatian honor guards, stood as the last four coffins, two covered

citizens.

   ``<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> when we take our leave from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Brown</ENAMEX> and all other
senior U.S. officials, on behalf of the whole of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Croatia</ENAMEX> and
myself, I express my deepest sympathy to the families of those who
have perished,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tudjman</ENAMEX> said. ``You will remain forever in our
memory.''
<p>
   He posthumously awarded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> a high Croatian decoration.
<p>
   In a brief euology, the American ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Croatia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter W.
Galbraith</ENAMEX>, reminded those present that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Easter eve</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> said in the Sermon on the Mount,'' the ambassador
said, ``blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the
children of God. Blessed indeed are our friends and colleagues who
perished on a mission of peace.''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> T-43 plane slammed into a rocky hill named after
St. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John the Baptist</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> in heavy rain and fog. The 35
passengers on board were killed, most instantly.
<p>
   The two Croatians and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> are the only victims whose bodies
have been identified. The remaining bodies, many badly burned or
mutilated, will be identified by forensic experts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United
States</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galbraith</ENAMEX> said the most fitting memorial would be to make peace
``a reality on the ground'' and to offer ``a vastly better future
to people who in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last five years</TIMEX> have suffered so much.''
<p>
   He called on Americans, Croats and Bosnians to build the
``decent, honorable and wonderfully ordinary lives that we
Americans too often take for granted.''
<p>
   The Roman Catholic archbishop of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zelimir Puljic</ENAMEX>, said
a prayer and blessed the remains. A bugler played taps before the
planes taxied to the runway and lifted off in a clear sky for the
11-hour journey.
<p>
   American investigators continued to search the crash site
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> and had cordoned off a debris-covered area with orange
tape and also marked several pieces of wreckage with tape. The
investigating team that will try to determine the causes of the
accident arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The white tail section of the plane, with the Stars and Stripes
visible, and a few rows of attached passenger seats are the only
large pieces left. A long black burn mark outlined where the body
of the aircraft probably had been. Down the steep, rocky hillside
lay part of the engine and a chunk of the fuselage.

<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Southern Helicopter Company</ENAMEX> aircraft was on its way to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zhuhai</ENAMEX>, apparently returning from an oil rig, when it crashed, said
a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil Aviation Department</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Other reports said the helicopter, which went down 10 to 15
nautical miles southeast of the Portuguese enclave, was gathering
weather information.
<p>
   The incident fell within <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> airspace, triggering a search
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil Aviation Department</ENAMEX> rescuers.
<p>
   Two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Flying Service</ENAMEX> helicopters joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau Marine
Police</ENAMEX> in the search for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sikorsky</ENAMEX> 76.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mainland</ENAMEX> authorities later told the department's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeronautical
Rescue Co-ordination Centre</ENAMEX> the wreckage had been recovered from
the Chinese island of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Daiwaishan</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``Someone on the island heard a noise and called <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zhuhai</ENAMEX> airport
authorities,'' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Macau</ENAMEX> aviation source. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> sent a
helicopter and confirmed the crash on the island.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Macau</ENAMEX> authorities, who lost radar contact at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 am</TIMEX>, said the
pilots had been found at the site ``and appeared dead''.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zhuhai</ENAMEX> officials confirmed the crew had been killed.
<p>
   Sources suggested that poor weather was the likely cause of the
crash.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Observatory</ENAMEX> reported strong winds in the area at the
time. Rescuers also reported poor visibility.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, as the country of registration, would investigate the
incident, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil Aviation Department</ENAMEX> said.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SAN FRANCISCO</ENAMEX>  &MD;  A 7-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pescadero</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, girl's dream of
making history by flying coast-to-coast in both directions ended in
tragedy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> when her light plane crashed in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cheyenne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyo.</ENAMEX>, rain, hail and snowstorm, killing her, her father
and her flight instructor.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica Dubroff</ENAMEX>, her father, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Dubroff</ENAMEX>, 57, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Mateo</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, corporate consultant, and her flight instructor and
co-pilot, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Reid</ENAMEX>, 52, all perished when the four-seat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cessna</ENAMEX>
Skyhawk went down in a residential neighborhood seconds after it's
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:24 PDT</TIMEX> takeoff in heavy rain, mixed with light hail and snow.
<p>
   ``We don't have any details except we are not expecting any
patients,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ginger Humphrey</ENAMEX>, a spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Medical
Center</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Witness <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Johnson</ENAMEX>, a pilot, said it appeared the pilot was
trying to return to the airport in the face of the rapidly
developing storm when ``it stalled over my building, winged over
and went straight into the ground like a dart.''
<p>
   ``I kept thinking, `Please, please get some altitude,''' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>
said, saying the plane never got more than 400 feet off the ground.
``It just went right into the ground. I knew no one survived. It
would have been impossible.''
<p>
   It was not immediately known who was at the controls, said
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cheyenne</ENAMEX> police spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Royce</ENAMEX>. But the ground rules for the
record attempt were that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reid</ENAMEX> was to touch the controls only in an
emergency and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dubroff</ENAMEX> was to ride in the back seat.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitch Barker</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX> said the small plane crashed about a mile north of the
airport after taking off to the west.
<p>
   ``It went in nose first,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dawn Salyards</ENAMEX>, a resident of the
area. ``From the looks of it you could tell, pretty much right
away, that there would be no survivors.''
<p>
   It barely missed one house, landing at the end of the driveway,
witnesses said. Debris was scattered throughout the neighborhood in
this quiet prairie city of about 50,000. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and police said
fuel spilled but there was no fire.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Within 20 minutes</TIMEX> of the crash, a tarp had been placed over the
plane. The only sections visible were the tail and wings, which
were crumpled.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Benson</ENAMEX>, spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety
Board</ENAMEX>, which investigates 2,000 plane crashes a year, said a team
was enroute from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX> to probe the crash.
<p>
   ``We will be looking at all aspects of the accident, from the
human factors to the mechanical,'' he said.
<p>
   Certain to be a focus of the investigation was the stunt itself,
the type of flight  &MD;  and pilot  &MD;  many air safety experts say should
be discouraged.
<p>
   ``The Guinness Book of Records'' had ceased recognizing the
``youngest pilot'' category for fear of encouraging unsafe flights.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barker</ENAMEX>, would not comment on the potential danger of
such record-breaking attempts. ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> was aware that there was a
record attempt being made by the 7-year-old,'' he said. ``This is
not the first time something like this has been attempted by
minors.
<p>
   ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s position is that the flight instructor is in
control. The 7-year-old was considered a passenger (and) was not
considered to be in control of the plane.''
<p>
   The minimum age for a pilot's license is 16.
<p>
   Before the flight, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX>'s father said the girl ``dragged her
mother and me into this'' and was not pushed by parental ambition.
<p>
   ``If she can do this, she can do anything,'' he said. ``And it
will expand her horizons. She's going see the country slide by
under her wing at 150 knots ... and she's going to be able to say,
`I did that.'''
<p>
   A man who answered the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reid</ENAMEX> home telephone in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Half Moon Bay</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, shortly after the crash, said, ``I'm sorry, we're not
making any comments right now.''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dubroff</ENAMEX> home telephone was not answered.

7-YEAR-OLD TRYING FOR PILOTING RECORD DIES IN CRASH
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times News Service</ENAMEX> clients)
By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ADAM PERTMAN</ENAMEX> AND <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JANE MEREDITH ADAMS</ENAMEX>
c.<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Boston Globe</ENAMEX>
    A 7-year-old girl, pursuing her dream of becoming the
youngest pilot to crisscross <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>, died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> when her plane
plummeted at the start of her journey's second leg.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica Dubroff</ENAMEX>'s body was found in the wreckage near the
municipal airport in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cheyenne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyo.</ENAMEX> Her father, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>, and her
flight instructor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Reid</ENAMEX>, also died in the crash.
<p>
   The three left an airfield outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pescadero</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>,
spent the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cheyenne</ENAMEX> and planned to conclude their trip by
meeting the young girl's mother in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Falmouth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> sent investigators to
the scene of the crash, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX>
said it would review its rules governing who may operate an
aircraft. The minimum age for taking a plane's controls alone is
16, but there's no restriction on anyone doing so alongside a
willing licensed pilot.
<p>
   ``I fly for joy. I'm going to fly till I fly solo. I'm going to
fly until I die,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX> said before leaving here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>. As
she climbed into her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cessna</ENAMEX> 177B in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyoming</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, she expressed
just one fear: ``crashing.'' But she went on to say she did not
worry about it.
<p>
   At 4-foot-2, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX> was too short to reach the plane's pedals,
so they were equipped with extenders for her. The craft had two
sets of controls, so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reid</ENAMEX> could take over  &MD;  as he did over the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rocky Mountains</ENAMEX> on the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyoming</ENAMEX>  &MD;  whenever he deemed it
necessary.
<p>
   Authorities said they were unsure who was guiding the plane when
it went down in driving rain and snow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, minutes
after attaining a height of only a few hundred feet. A witness, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom
Johnson</ENAMEX>, said he saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cessna</ENAMEX> stall over the building where he
worked and then nose-dive ``like a dart'' before smashing into the
ground near a driveway and scores of houses and cars.
<p>
   Why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reid</ENAMEX> allowed the flight to take place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> is a mystery.
Asked about his pending trip before leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pescadero</ENAMEX>, he replied:
``Basically the only ground rule is good weather. ... If there's
any weather ahead of us that doesn't look good, we're either going
to wait it out or go around it.''
<p>
   The girl's parents, who did not live together, sought to give
her an untraditional upbringing. Her mother, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Blair Hathaway</ENAMEX>,
taught <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX> and her two other young children at home. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd
Dubroff</ENAMEX> tried to provide what he described as a ``real world''
education  &MD;  for example, encouraging <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX> to try and break the
record for youngest cross-country pilot.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hathaway</ENAMEX> told reporters in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Falmouth</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that she had no
second thoughts about how she was rearing her children and
suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX>'s death should not lead other parents to
impose undue restrictions on their own.
<p>
   ``I beg people to let children fly if they want to fly,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hathaway</ENAMEX> said, crying. ``Clearly I would want all my children to
die in a state of joy, but not at age 7 ... I know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jess</ENAMEX> did her
best.''
<p>
   At <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan International Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hathaway</ENAMEX> left
for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyoming</ENAMEX>, she added that she just wanted to get to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cheyenne</ENAMEX> to
``hold my child, dead or alive.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Hathaway</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ashburnham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, who accompanied her sister
to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan</ENAMEX>, defended <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX>'s mother. ``She was just very
supportive; she wanted her children to experience different things,
so she supported them in doing those kinds of things,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan
Hathaway</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX> lived with her mother, 9-year-old brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joshua</ENAMEX>, and
3-year-old sister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jasmine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pescadero</ENAMEX>, a farming and fishing
community 50 miles south of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>. Her father lived in the
nearby city of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Mateo</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Both parents thought their children should be educated through
unconventional means like flying  &MD;  to learn weather-forecasting,
geography and physics  &MD;  riding horses and building furniture. ``I'm
the culprit,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Dubroff</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this week</TIMEX>, when he told
reporters he first suggested <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX> try flying coast-to-coast.
<p>
   ``They're getting a tremendous education from having their lives
be in the real world,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hathaway</ENAMEX>, 41, told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco
Examiner</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX> embarked on her attempt to set a record.
Had she succeeded, it wouldn't have been official because the
Guinness Book of World Records eliminated its ``youngest pilot''
category <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years ago</TIMEX> out of concern it might encourage unsafe
flying.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX>, who would have turned 8 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</TIMEX>, had less than a
month to set the unofficial record. It was set in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel
Shanklin</ENAMEX>, who was one day shy of 8 when he flew from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kill Devil Hills</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX>, along with her two siblings also took music lessons,
including piano and trumpet. All were encouraged to excel and take
risks, friends and neighbors said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pescadero</ENAMEX> community flag was lowered to half-staff in her
memory and a local florist hung out a sign that read, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX>,
you inspired all of us. Keep soaring.''
<p>
   For the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50</NUMEX>-an-hour flying lessons, paid for by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Dubroff</ENAMEX>,
57, a corporate consultant in nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Mateo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX>'s mother
would drive a white minivan to the hangar at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Half Moon Bay Airport</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Benson</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX>, said, ``We will be
looking at everything related to this accident.'' He said crashes
involving child aviators are rare. ``Our initial search of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX>
records does not turn anything up.'' He said the safety board will
``look at any regulations or requirements that could have played a
factor in this.''

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HALF MOON BAY</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Reid</ENAMEX>, who died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> when the
airplane he was flying with 7-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica Dubroff</ENAMEX> and her
father crashed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cheyenne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyo.</ENAMEX>, took up flying the same way he
did anything else: with passion and attention to detail.
<p>
   ``I respected his leadership, his thoroughness,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary
Petersen</ENAMEX>, manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Half Moon Bay Airport</ENAMEX>. ``He was always capable
and competent, a real by-the-book guy  &MD;  very thorough, very
detailed.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reid</ENAMEX>, 52, who for nearly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27 years</TIMEX> was a broker at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean
Witter Reynolds</ENAMEX> office in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, was president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Half Moon
Bay Pilots Association</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Auld</ENAMEX>, a longtime friend who co-owned the aircraft that
crashed, said he had first taken <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reid</ENAMEX> up in a small plane in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>.
He said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reid</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX> veteran, got his pilot's license in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1970s</TIMEX> and was certified to be an instructor about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years
ago</TIMEX>.
<p>
   They bought the plane, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX> single-engine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cessna</ENAMEX> 177B
Cardinal, about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine years ago</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``He loved flying and helping other people learn the excitement
of flying,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Auld</ENAMEX> said. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX>'s not the type to do anything half
way.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reid</ENAMEX> began giving lessons to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX> about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five months ago</TIMEX> and
was supportive of her effort to become the youngest person ever to
make a round-trip, cross-country flight in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``I'm teaching her just like I would anybody else,'' he said.
``Mentally, she grasps the concepts as well as an adult.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forrest Storz</ENAMEX>, who also gives flying lessons at the airport,
called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reid</ENAMEX> ``an exceptional, competent pilot.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> that a pilot was probably
showing off for his parents when he crashed an F-14A jet fighter in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>, killing himself, a fellow officer and three
people on the ground.
<p>
   The pilot, Lt. Comdr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Stacy Bates</ENAMEX>, had been grounded for a
month in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1995</TIMEX> after he lost control of another F-14A after
taking off from the aircraft carrier USS Lincoln. The plane crashed
after the pilot and his crew ejected. The crew members were
rescued.
<p>
   Rear Adm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Smith</ENAMEX>, who investigated the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX> crash,
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX>' judgment was influenced by his parents' presence at the
field'' and his desire to show them risky takeoff and flight
maneuvers.
<p>
   The admiral said that in taking off from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX> airport
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 29</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX> ascended at an angle steeper than 50 degrees,
violating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> rules.
<p>
   After the near-perpendicular takeoff, in the clouds, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> said,
the pilot became disoriented, and in all likelihood did not realize
that he was heading earthward until his jet pierced the clouds at
2,300 feet.
<p>
   By then, the admiral said, it was too late to prevent the plane
from smashing into the house of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elmer and Ada Newsom</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX>, 33, and his radar intercept officer, Lt.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Alden Higgins</ENAMEX>, 28, those killed were the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newsoms</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ewing
Wair</ENAMEX>, who was visiting them.
<p>
   The crash would never have happened had the pilot made a normal
take-off or taken the cloudy weather into account, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> said after
an 11-week review of the incident.

REACTIONS TO DEATH OF ONE CHILD PILOT MAY GROUND OTHERS

<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">PLAINVILLE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The boys, ages 12 to 14, peered intensely at
their instructor, their red textbooks open to Lesson 23:
``Emergency Procedures, Wind Shear, Turbulence.'' The instructor,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Calla</ENAMEX>, began. ``What are some types of emergencies?,'' he
asked. ``Engine failure,'' one student said. ``Electrical fire,''
said another. ``Ice,'' someone else piped in.
<p>
   The boys are students in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cloud Chasers</ENAMEX>, a six-year-old nonprofit
program that seeks to build motivation and raise self-esteem by
teaching young people how to fly airplanes.
<p>
   Every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> they practice on the ground and in the
sky with instructors from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Robertson Airport</ENAMEX>, a tiny airstrip in
this tiny town just west of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hartford</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cloud Chasers</ENAMEX> fly in planes with dual controls and with an
instructor in the next seat. They labor over pre-flight safety
checks. For practice, they simulate stalls in flight.
<p>
   They do not fly to break records. And they are all older than
7-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica Dubroff</ENAMEX>, who died, with her father and flight
instructor, in a crash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX> as she tried to become the
youngest person to fly across the country.
<p>
   But the reaction to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX>'s crash may ground these young
pilots sooner than any emergency for which they rehearse.
<p>
   Federal law requires student pilots to be at least 16 years old
before they are allowed to fly solo. Younger children can fly as
long as there is a licensed pilot sitting next to them at the
controls and acting as pilot in command.
<p>
   But since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX>'s crash, three Republican state senators from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX> are seeking to ban children under the age of 16 from
flying.
<p>
   Sens. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin F. Rennie</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rocky Hill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Nielsen</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danbury</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John A. Kissel</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Enfield</ENAMEX> proposed the ban, and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> voted to add it to a bill dealing with child restraints
in automobiles. The amendment states: ``No person under the age of
16 shall engage in the operation of aircraft. No person shall aid a
person under the age of 16 in the operation of aircraft.'' The bill
itself must now go before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> for ratification.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rennie</ENAMEX> said that he and his supporters considered the ban a
safety precaution that would close an inadvertent gap in the
federal law. He said the ban came at a time when the legislature
was also banning newly licensed drivers from the roads <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between
midnight and 5 a.m.</TIMEX>
<p>
   ``We're putting restrictions on driving a car for six months
after you get your license,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rennie</ENAMEX> said. ``At the same time we
will be debating whether or not someone younger than that can be
flying an airplane, and it strikes me as one of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kafka</ENAMEX> moments
in the legislature.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calla</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cloud Chasers</ENAMEX> instructor, sees the ban as
misguided.
<p>
   Federal safety investigators who looked into the crash said they
believed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX>'s instructor was in control of the airplane when
it went down just after takeoff.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calla</ENAMEX> and others involved with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cloud Chasers</ENAMEX> noted that the
responsibility for the flight  &MD;  and, they say, for any pilot error
that would have contributed to the crash  &MD;  lay with the pilot in
command, not with the 7-year-old.
<p>
   The ban, they say, would end one of the only programs in the
country dedicated specifically to teaching young people to fly
responsibly, and even worse, they say, would be the lost
opportunity to teach lessons about life through aviation.
<p>
   ``I am the adult,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calla</ENAMEX> said. ``I am in control of the
aircraft. I am the sole person responsible for keeping us out of
harm's way. It really aggravates me that they want to throw it all
away when we could be educating the world in the correct procedures
in handling the safe operation of aircraft, making students more
knowledgeable about the world around them, opening up their eyes to
new horizons, all in an environment that has a safety net: the
flight instructor.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Tortorici</ENAMEX>, a public school art teacher who volunteers as the
director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cloud Chasers</ENAMEX>, said that students in the program would
have known better than to take off in a storm like the one in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyoming</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``This school is designed to raise self-esteem, to foster
decision-making, including the kind of decision that would have
kept that plane on the ground,'' he said.``We're not training
pilots. We are training mature adults.''
<p>
   Indeed, learning how to fly also involves learning more than a
smattering of physics, mathematics and meteorology, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cloud
Chasers</ENAMEX> students portray a seriousness beyond their years.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Brewer</ENAMEX>, 14, said he would not fly in bad weather. ``It's a
safe way to play it,'' he said. ``I think that a good portion of
things we learn here are how to make judgments. We learn the more
technical aspects of flying. We learn why stalls happen. We
practice stalls and go and actually do the maneuvers in the
plane.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathan Sheely</ENAMEX>, 14, said he had been fascinated by planes since
birth. The hardest thing about learning to fly, he said, was
learning ``to always be a step ahead of the aircraft, to know
what's going to happen before it happens and to know what to do.''
<p>
   State Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rennie</ENAMEX> said he had not heard of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cloud Chasers</ENAMEX>
program until his office received a call from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calla</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>.
But he said he remained firm in his belief that youngsters should
not fly.
<p>
   ``With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cloud Chasers</ENAMEX> you may have found the best example, with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica Dubroff</ENAMEX> you may have the worst, most egregious example,''
he said. ``Most of the examples probably fall in between. We make
public policy with a broader brush and so we have to make some
decisions that apply equally to both extremes.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rennie</ENAMEX> also said he had received a call from a constituent who
lets his 9-year-old fly the family plane and who invited the
Senator to come up for a ride. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rennie</ENAMEX> begged off. ``I don't like
flying in big planes,'' the senator said, ``let alone in small
planes.''

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Providence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rhode Island</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 24</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Textron Inc.</ENAMEX>
is discussing the sale of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paul Revere Corp.</ENAMEX> disability
insurance unit to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provident Cos. Inc.</ENAMEX> for about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 billion</NUMEX>, a
person familiar with the talks said.
<p>
   The talks are part of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Providence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rhode Island</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Textron</ENAMEX>'s
efforts to shed financial services units and focus on core
manufacturing businesses, which include making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cessna</ENAMEX> aircraft,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell</ENAMEX> helicopters and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E-Z-GO</ENAMEX> golf carts.
<p>
   For <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chattanooga</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provident</ENAMEX>, an acquisition would
be the latest step in the company's effort to reorganize and expand
through insuring policyholders against loss of income if they
suffer a debilitating accident or illness.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Textron</ENAMEX> Chief Financial Officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Key</ENAMEX> declined to comment
on the likelihood of selling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paul Revere</ENAMEX>. His company ``has been
saying all along'' that it plans to reduce its presence in
financial services, he said, declining to elaborate.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provident</ENAMEX> wouldn't comment on any potential acquisitions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provident</ENAMEX> Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas White</ENAMEX> said, ``We have said it is
our strategy to grow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provident</ENAMEX>.''
<p>
   News of the talks was reported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s Wall Street Journal.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provident</ENAMEX> stock fell 1/8 to 30 7/8 in early trading. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Textron</ENAMEX> shares
rose 3/4 to 88 7/8.
<p>
   Officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paul Revere</ENAMEX> weren't available for comment. Its
shares rose 3/4 to 25.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Worcester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paul Revere</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83 percent</NUMEX> owned by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Textron</ENAMEX>, has been a laggard among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Textron</ENAMEX>'s six operating units,
and especially among its finance-oriented businesses. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>,
revenue at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paul Revere</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 percent</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.52 billion</NUMEX> while
operating income dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 percent</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$123 million</NUMEX>. Revenue also
rose as income declined in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>.
<p>
   While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paul Revere</ENAMEX> has had trouble with rising benefit costs,
results are just the opposite at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Textron</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avco Financial Services</ENAMEX>
unit, a consumer finance company, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Textron Financial Corp.</ENAMEX>, a
commercial finance company.
<p>
   Revenue in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Textron Financial</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 percent</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>
on a combined basis to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">$1.99 billion</NUMEX>, with operating income
increasing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">$365 million</NUMEX>.
<p>
   Given the performance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paul Revere</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX> analyst
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Shapiro</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Textron</ENAMEX> has been looking ``to extricate''
itself from the insurance company in favor of acquiring more
manufacturing businesses.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">LOS ANGELES</ENAMEX>  &MD;  A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest Airlines</ENAMEX> jetliner en route from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las
Vegas</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Burbank</ENAMEX> made an emergency landing at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ontario International
Airport</ENAMEX> after the landing gear failed to fully lower, but none of
the 132 people aboard was hurt.
<p>
   The left landing gear of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737-300 failed to lower all
the way <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, so the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Burbank</ENAMEX> tower diverted Flight 1767 to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ontario</ENAMEX>, which has longer runways.
<p>
   After several failed efforts to shake the stuck gear loose, the
pilot landed the plane in a lopsided position, with just the nose
wheel and right landing gear down.
<p>
   ``Everybody was really amazingly calm. I don't know whether it
was shock, but there didn't seem to be any sense of panic,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Spears</ENAMEX>, 49, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Hollywood</ENAMEX>, who said he was on the
flight. ``I have been on much rougher landings with both sets of
landing gears. It was amazingly smooth.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spears</ENAMEX> said he was returning home from an overnight getaway to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The nearly full flight, with 127 passengers and five crew
members aboard, had left <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 p.m.</TIMEX> and was due in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Burbank</ENAMEX>
at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 p.m.</TIMEX>
<p>
   The pilot, an eight-year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> veteran, landed the jetliner
safely at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:40 p.m.</TIMEX> on the north runway, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melanie Jones</ENAMEX>, a
spokeswoman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>. She refused to identify
the pilot, citing company policy.
<p>
   ``No passengers or crew were injured,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Tesoro</ENAMEX>, a
spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontario Airport</ENAMEX>. ``All the passengers are safe, and
the cause of the difficulty with the landing gear is unknown.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spears</ENAMEX> said passengers became aware of the problem when the jet
began its descent toward <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Burbank</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``As he was lowering the landing gear, there was a real loud
thump, much louder than normal. About 45 seconds later, there was
another loud thump,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spears</ENAMEX> recounted.
<p>
   The pilot announced that a light on the instrument panel
indicated the landing gear hadn't engaged, and he would circle the
jet past the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Burbank Airport</ENAMEX> tower to see if the controllers could
spot a malfunction, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spears</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   That strategy failed because the plane couldn't fly low enough
for the tower to see the wheel, so the flight was rerouted to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ontario</ENAMEX>, located 35 miles east of downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The pilot did a low fly-by past the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ontario</ENAMEX> control tower, and
at that point airport officials verified the landing gear was
stuck, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spears</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   The flight crew twice tried a maneuver to knock the landing gear
free: sharply climbing and accelerating, and then abruptly cutting
back the power. ``He called it a `maximum G-force maneuver,' and it
was basically (intended) to try to jolt it down by force of
gravity,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spears</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   ``It really was like a roller coaster. Our stomachs went up past
our throats and into our noses,'' he joked.
<p>
   When that technique didn't work, the pilot announced he would
try a hard touch-and-go landing on the one free wheel, in hopes the
hard impact would jolt the other wheel down, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spears</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   ``He told everybody: `There's no need to be alarmed. We do this
thing all the time  &MD;  in simulators,' and everybody groaned.''
<p>
   Again, the attempt failed. The pilot announced the only option
left was an emergency landing. Flight attendants began
demonstrating crash precautions as the plane circled to burn off
and dump excess fuel, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spears</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   The crew asked younger, stronger passengers to sit near the
exits and help with evacuations, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spears</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Passengers were directed to take off their glasses and
high-heeled shoes. ``We started a really slow descent into the
airport,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spears</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   ``The captain came on and said we would only be going about 60
mph. They would try to set it down on the one wheel, and they would
try to ease it down really slowly,'' he said.
<p>
   As the jet landed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spears</ENAMEX> said he could see ``the fire trucks
racing down the runway beside us.'' Firefighters sprayed
fire-retardant foam on the plane as a precaution.
<p>
   ``The captain said: `Stay in your seats. We're on the ground
safely,''' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spears</ENAMEX> said. ``At that point, everybody cheered.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> said the jetliner had just undergone a ``major maintenance
inspection'' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 16</TIMEX>, but she wasn't sure whether the landing gear
was checked at that time. Such periodic inspections are required by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX>, she noted.
<p>
   ``We know that the landing gear wouldn't come down, (but) we
don't know the cause of the malfunction,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> sent aircraft mechanics out to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ontario</ENAMEX> to inspect the
plane, she said.
<p>
   ``We took it new from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years ago</TIMEX>. That's very new
for an aircraft,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   ``We have a perfect safety record <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">for 25 years</TIMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> said.
``Occasionally, we have things go wrong, as with any piece of
equipment with mechanical parts. But we think our crew did a
wonderful job of landing the airplane.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> offered the stranded passengers an option: a ride to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Burbank Airport</ENAMEX> or a motel room near the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ontario Airport</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>
said.
<p>
   ``The (north) runway was closed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes prior to the
landing of the airplane</TIMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tesoro</ENAMEX> noted, but she didn't know how
many landings and takeoffs were delayed or diverted while the north

<p>
   Eighteen months after an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Eagle</ENAMEX> turboprop plane crashed
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Roselawn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ind.</ENAMEX>, killing all 68 people aboard, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal
Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> issued its answers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> to one series
of questions raised by the accident. And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, the agency begins
addressing new questions raised by the very same crash.
<p>
   Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Roselawn</ENAMEX> crash, the agency has worked to gain a better
understanding of the effects of flying in icy weather, in
particular a rare condition in which tiny droplets of water are
suspended in the atmosphere below freezing temperature.
<p>
   When those liquid droplets strike a surface like an airplane
wing, they freeze on contact. Investigators believe a ridge of ice
formed on the wing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Eagle</ENAMEX> turboprop  &MD;  an ATR-72  &MD; 
causing it to tilt uncontrollably and crash.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> issued a series of so-called airworthiness
directives affecting 29 types of turboprop aircraft  &MD;  the kind
typically used by regional commuter airlines  &MD;  that have a long
rubber bladder along the leading edge of their wings to crack and
shed ice.
<p>
   The regulations instruct pilots to look for signs of ice
accumulating on windows, wings or propeller hubs. If they see it,
they are supposed to change altitude or direction quickly.
<p>
   To reach that relatively simple ruling, however, required an
enormous amount of testing of these aircraft by the aviation agency
and their manufacturers.
<p>
   Those tests included measuring the tilting forces created while
taxiing at high-speeds with wooden shapes attached to the wings. In
addition, some aircraft were flown behind a tanker plane, which
sprayed them with water to see how they would perform in such
conditions.
<p>
   The aviation agency has determined that the French-made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATR</ENAMEX>
aircraft were the only turboprop commuter planes now flying in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> that required a design modification.
<p>
   The manufacturer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avions de Transport Regional</ENAMEX>, with the
agency's approval, agreed to enlarge the rubber bladder along the
leading edge so that it covered more of the top of the wing. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATR</ENAMEX>
spokeswoman said the company had modified the wings of all its
aircraft worldwide that flew in conditions where such icy weather
might occur.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony J. Broderick</ENAMEX>, the agency's associate administrator for
regulation and certification, said that because the tests were so
rigorous, he was confident that a crash like the one in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Roselawn</ENAMEX>
would not occur again.
<p>
   ``We have closed the door on the safety issues,'' he said. He
added that since <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Roselawn</ENAMEX>, no airlines or pilots had filed reports
on planes upset in icy weather.
<p>
   Even so, questions about icy weather remain, and many of them
will be discussed starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> during a three-day conference on
in-flight icing at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Springfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX> About 400 aviation experts from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> and many foreign countries are expected to
attend.
<p>
   Those and other discussions may lead, in months or even years,
to new standards that manufacturers must meet before the aviation
agency certifies their aircraft.
<p>
   The current standards have been in place since the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940s</TIMEX>, and
were not changed after a review in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960s</TIMEX>. In broad terms, those
standards take into account most weather conditions that occur most
of the time.
<p>
   But as more turboprops fly more frequently, the chances of
encountering the rare but hazardous condition known as
``super-cooled drizzle drops'' rises.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broderick</ENAMEX> said his agency's goals included developing better
ways to forecast these conditions and possibly develop equipment to
alert pilots that they are flying in such conditions. Generally,
these conditions occur in relatively narrow bands in the sky, and
experts say that changing altitude by 2,000 or 3,000 feet is often
enough to escape the situation.
<p>
   The aviation agency is currently spending about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400,000</NUMEX> a year
on research into the problem. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broderick</ENAMEX> said the agency also
planned to start testing some smaller aircraft that are not used by
commercial airlines but that do use the rubber de-icing system.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>, which investigates
accidents, is expected to issue its conclusions about what caused
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Roselawn</ENAMEX> crash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">within two months</TIMEX>.

4 DIE IN CRASH OF MILITARY HELICOPTER

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">STRATFORD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  A helicopter making a test flight before it
was to be delivered to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> to provide cargo service
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> appeared to lose its rotors on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> and
crashed onto the flight field of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sikorsky Aircraft Corp.</ENAMEX>,
killing all four crew members.
<p>
   Hovering at the height of the nearby Sikorsky Bridge, where the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Merritt Parkway</ENAMEX> crosses the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Housatonic River</ENAMEX>, the CH53E helicopter
 &MD;  also known as the Super Stallion for its size and power  &MD; 
appeared to be in distress, witnesses said, with smoke issuing from
it before its 40-foot rotors broke off.
<p>
   ``The helicopter was up in the air; it's normal for us to see
them,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Nasufi</ENAMEX>, who spotted it as he was loading pizzas
from his restaurant above the river for a lunchtime delivery to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sikorsky</ENAMEX> workers. ``The helicopter had smoke coming out, and all of
a sudden it lost its blades, and that was it. It came straight
down.''
<p>
   The explosion shook nearby buildings and stopped traffic on the
bridge, from which the crushed fuselage could be seen burning on
the tarmac less than half a mile away, about 50 feet from the
river. The craft's distress had lasted long enough for one driver
to call a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bridgeport</ENAMEX> radio station to report that a helicopter was
in trouble.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sikorsky</ENAMEX> officials said all four peole on board were employees.
Their names were withheld until relatives could be notified.
<p>
   A spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sikorsky</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gina McAllister</ENAMEX>, said the heavy-lift
helicopter, which can carry a payload of 31 tons, was to be
assigned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine</ENAMEX> base at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quantico</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX> The helicopter would
have been used to ferry limousines and other advance equipment for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. She said it would not have carried the president.
<p>
   The crash occurred at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11:08 a.m.</TIMEX> Witnesses differed as to
whether the craft had burst into flames before it dropped onto the
flight field, or upon impact. But many said that before the craft
fell, its three rotor blades shot off. One landed across the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Housatonic River</ENAMEX>, which borders the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sikorsky</ENAMEX> property, one flew
toward the Sikorsky Bridge, and the third fell toward the assembly
plant.
<p>
   Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McAllister</ENAMEX> said the cause of the crash was not known. With
the approval of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>, she said, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sikorsky Aircraft</ENAMEX>
would conduct the safety investigation with the participation of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy Safety Center</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> have purchased 150 of the
heavy-lift helicopters, which can be used for amphibious assaults,
carrying cargo and recovering aircraft, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jane's</ENAMEX> All the
World's Aircraft. CH53E's were used to rescue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> Capt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott
O'Grady</ENAMEX> when he was shot down over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosnia</ENAMEX>, and to evacuate the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
embassy in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Somalia</ENAMEX>, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McAllister</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   ``This helicopter has a very proud tradition, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON|ORGANIZATION">Sikorsky</ENAMEX>
family is devastated by this mishap,'' she said.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CAMP LEJEUNE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Fourteen marines were killed and two were
injured before dawn <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> when two helicopters collided and
plunged into a densely forested marsh in an isolated part of this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> base in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The cause of the crash, which happened at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 a.m.</TIMEX> during a huge
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-British amphibious-assault exercise, is still under
investigation, officials said.
<p>
   Of the injured, one was listed in critical condition at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pitt
County Memorial Hospital</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>, and the other was
listed in serious condition at the base hospital. No British troops
were involved in the crash.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Press</ENAMEX> reported that officials at the base
identified three of the dead as First Lt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur J. Schneider</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Livingston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>,; Maj. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael D. Kuszewski</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Devens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>
and Capt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott T. Rice</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Springfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mo.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midafternoon</TIMEX> 11 bodies of the crash victims had been
recovered from the scene. But it took until about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4:30 p.m.</TIMEX> for the
final three bodies to be recovered from the muddy and wooded area
where rescuers toiled for more than 16 hours. It was an indication,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marine</ENAMEX> spokesman said, of the conditions in the forest.
<p>
   The search was hampered as tractors sank up to their tread tops
in the muck and rescuers resorted to cutting pathways with
chainsaws and fashioning walkways over the shifting ground with
slabs of plywood.
<p>
   ``It is very thick pine forest and swamp,'' said Maj. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve
Little</ENAMEX>, a spokesman. ``It has been difficult, especially difficult
before dawn as we began the recovery. It has been made easier with
more light.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little</ENAMEX> said the marines were part of a joint exercise including
38,200 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> troops and 15,600 British troops. The helicopters
involved were an AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopter with a
two-person crew and a CH-46E Sea Knight, an assault and transport
helicopter that can carry as many as 22 people in addition to its
crew of four.
<p>
   The helicopters had taken off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier that night</TIMEX> from ships
massed off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX> coast and headed inland to where the
accident occurred near the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Courthouse Bay</ENAMEX> boat basin at the
150,000-acre military base.
<p>
   Flight operations in the British-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> exercises were suspended,
although surface operations would continue, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>'s accident was deadliest for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>,
when 14 people were killed in the crash of another Sea Knight off
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Okinawa</ENAMEX>. More than twice as many marines have died in aviation
accidents in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last eight months</TIMEX> as were killed in such accidents
in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">previous two years</TIMEX>. The total killed so far <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> in
aviation accidents, counting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>'s deaths, is 19. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> there
were six aviation deaths and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> there were only three such
deaths.
<p>
   It was a Harrier jet crash here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> that prompted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine
Corps</ENAMEX> to order a rare 48-hour suspension of all fixed-wing and
helicopter flights to conduct emergency safety checks. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that
year</TIMEX>, 12 people were killed in aircraft accidents. As recently as
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> called another two-day halt to all aircraft
flights for emergency checks.
<p>
   Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe C. Yannessa</ENAMEX>, commander of the rescue operation, said
the collision had occurred in midair over the densely pine-forested
marshland and rained debris over a 150 yard area. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yannessa</ENAMEX> said
rescue crews on foot and carrying nothing more than their packs and
hand-held fire extinguishers got to the section of swamp 600 yards
from the nearest road <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="within 30 minutes">within 30 minutes of the crash</TIMEX>. There were
several smoldering, but not intense, fires scattered throughout the
area, he said.
<p>
   ``The aircraft frankly is in such a state of destruction that
there are no identifying marks that we could see on the aircraft,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yannessa</ENAMEX> said. ``They were sunk 3 to 4 to 5 feet into the muck.''

<p>
   A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> DC-9 jetliner with 109 people aboard crashed in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida Everglades</ENAMEX> shortly after takeoff from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami International
Airport</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>. Aviation and rescue officials found
widely scattered debris and said there were apparently no
survivors.
<p>
   Bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, the twin-engine aircraft was about 30 miles
northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" MIN="Miami">Miami airport</ENAMEX> when the pilot reported smoke in the
cockpit, a spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> said.
The plane was believed to be turning back to the airport when radar
contact was lost shortly after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 p.m.</TIMEX>
<p>
   ``We believe that the aircraft is down somewhere in the vicinity
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida Everglades</ENAMEX>,'' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> spokesman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Willett</ENAMEX>,
said.
<p>
   The cause of the crash was unclear. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet Airlines Inc.</ENAMEX>, which
is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> and serves 26 cities in 17 states, began
operations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> with an old fleet that has grown to about 50
planes.
<p>
   It has experienced a number of problems, including several
aircraft that have run off runways and one that caught fire, but
never a crash.
<p>
   Television pictures from helicopters flying over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX>
at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midafternoon</TIMEX> showed no shattered fuselage, tail assembly or
other large sections of the plane, only what appeared to be widely
scattered pieces of whitish debris that flecked the high grasses
and desolate swamps. It was unclear how deep the water was.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> said the crash site was 15 miles west of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Opa Locka</ENAMEX>, or
about 20 miles northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>. But it was unclear by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late
Saturday afternoon</TIMEX> whether the precise crash site had been located.
<p>
   One aerial picture showed a depression and what appeared to be
scorched earth, but rescue pilots found no clear signs of wreckage
or survivors from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s Flight 592, a daily two-hour flight
from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The crash site appeared to be inaccessible by road. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast
Guard</ENAMEX> dispatched rescue helicopters and aircraft to the site, and
airboats were being mustered to carry rescue and other emergency
personnel to the area.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> said in a statement that the plane was carrying 104
passengers and a crew of five. Earlier reports had said that as
many as 112 and as few as 90 were on board.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s fleet, said to be the oldest in the industry, has run
into a series of problems in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last two and a half years</TIMEX>, the
most serious being a fire on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 8 last year</TIMEX> that destroyed a DC-9
on a runway in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   A flight attendant was burned and six other injuries were
reported as 57 passengers and 5 crew members were evacuated.
<p>
   An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> investigation in the wake of the fire found ``a
significant decrease in the experience level of new pilots being
hired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> as well as other positions, such as mechanics and
dispatchers.''
<p>
   The inquiry said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s rapid expansion from two to 48 planes
had been accompanied by accidents and incidents involving
inexperienced pilots, inadequate maintenance and insufficiently
trained flight attendants.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>, which had proclaimed itself the fastest-growing airline
in history, said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> that it would buy fewer airplanes than
it planned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> and would ``concentrate on its product
integrity'' in anticipation of the summer Olympic Games in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last Jan. 12</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> DC-9 with 30 people aboard slid into a
snowbank after landing at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dulles International Airport</ENAMEX> outside
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, closing the airport for three hours.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 26</TIMEX>, another a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> DC-9 got stuck in the mud at
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport</ENAMEX> and 101 passengers had to
be bused back to the terminal.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 28</TIMEX>, another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> plane ran off a runway in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Savannah</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ga.</ENAMEX> And on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mar. 19</TIMEX>, an emergency chute inflated inside the cabin of
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> plane in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tampa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, slightly injuring a flight
attendant; the pilot had to crawl out a window, climb into the
plane through the tailcone and cut the chute with a knife to free
the attendant.
<p>
   Because of the inaccessibility of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>'s crash site, few
details were available in the hours immediately after the plane
went down. In its statement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> said that Flight 592 had left
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> at about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:15 p.m.</TIMEX>, more than 70 minutes after its regularly
scheduled departure time.
<p>
   It said the DC-9-32, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell-Douglas</ENAMEX> plane configured with
seats for 113 passengers, radioed at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:25 p.m.</TIMEX> that it was
returning to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> statement did not mention smoke in the cabin, but
other reports said the pilot had spoken to air-traffic controllers
of smoke in the cabin.
<p>
   The airline quoted preliminary reports as saying the plane went
down about 20 miles northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> ``in a dense area of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida Everglades</ENAMEX>, making accessibility difficult.''
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three hours after the crash</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> reported that the jet had
been about 100 miles northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> when the pilot reported
smoke in the cockpit, and that after turning around had gone about
80 miles before crashing.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> report said the plane had apparently gone into a steep
dive and exploded on impact.
<p>
   A student pilot, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick DeLisle</ENAMEX>, who was flying a small plane in
the area with an instructor, bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Naples</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla</ENAMEX>, told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX> of
witnessing the crash. After hearing his instructor yelling, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLisle</ENAMEX>
said, ``I turned and saw an explosion.''
<p>
   ``There was nothing in the sense of fire,'' he said. ``It was
almost like what I would call a mushroom cloud. It went up 100
feet.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLisle</ENAMEX> said he and his instructor flew closer and examined the
ground with binoculars. ``We got down to about 200 feet or so, and
with the binocs it looked like a large trash bag worth of debris.''
<p>
   As word of the crash was flashed over news reports, relatives of
people who had been on board went to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami International Airport</ENAMEX>,
seeking information on what had happened.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hernando Vergera</ENAMEX>, an airport spokesman, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Dade
County Aviation</ENAMEX> was bringing counselors to meet with family
members, about 50 of whom were at the airport. They were being
taken to an undisclosed location for privacy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vergera</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> personnel at the airport declined to comment, and had
minimal contact with the families of the victims, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vergera</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> did not immediately return telephone messages.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> told The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Press</ENAMEX> that rescue aircraft
were helping to look for wreckage and survivors. But all that
rescue pilots could detect was scorched earth, Petty Officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angela
Weeks</ENAMEX> said.

109 FEARED DEAD IN <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EVERGLADES</ENAMEX> CRASH
By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GEORGE BENNETT</ENAMEX>

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MIAMI</ENAMEX>  &MD;  A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> DC-9 jetliner headed for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> with 109
people on board crashed in the marshy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX> about 20 miles
northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami International Airport</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Flight 592 plunged into a swampy expanse of sawgrass more about
10 miles from the nearest road in an area accessible only by
helicopter or airboat.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> said Flight 592 was about
100 miles west of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> when its pilot reported smoke in the
cockpit and turned to go back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> shortly after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 p.m.</TIMEX>
<p>
   An eyewitness said the plane dived nose down at a 75-degree
angle.
<p>
   ``Nothing could have survived that,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Muelhaupt</ENAMEX>, who
told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX> he was piloting a private plane with a student and was
about two miles from the DC-9.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muelhaupt</ENAMEX> said he first thought the plane was a smaller craft
practicing maneuvers. He saw no smoke or fire coming from the
plane, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muelhaupt</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   His flying student, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick DeLisle</ENAMEX>, told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX> the impact of the
plane created a mushroom cloud about 100 feet high.
<p>
   ``It just looked like a large trash bag was blown open,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLisle</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   The plane crashed into at least four feet of water and debris
sank into several feet of muck below, fire-rescue officials said.
<p>
   All that was visible from the air was flotsam spread over a
50-yard area.
<p>
   The crash site is about 20 miles northwest of the airport in an
area inhabited primarily by snakes, alligators and mosquitos.
Rescue workers put out a call for anti-venin as a precaution
against possible snake bites.
<p>
   ``Accessibility is extremely difficult,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro-Dade</ENAMEX> Lt.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Fernandez</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``You cannot see the total fuselage,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.D. Paulison</ENAMEX>,
director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro-Dade Fire Rescue</ENAMEX>. ``There were no tail pieces to
see. There were no wing pieces to see. There was nothing at all.''
<p>
   A sheen of highly flammable aviation fuel on the water hampered
initial rescue efforts and attempts to recover the plane's flight
recorder, or ``black box.''
<p>
   A <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> investigator said the
recorder aboard Flight 592 was an older model that would not
provide as many clues to the crash as newer, more sophisticated
models.
<p>
   A plane crash in a swamp is one of the worst-case scenarios in
the rescue business, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Wright</ENAMEX>, a special operations chief
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palm Beach County Fire Rescue</ENAMEX>, which practiced such a rescue
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Between the waist-deep watery mud, sawgrass so sharp it can
slice rescue worker's gear and the alligators and snakes, access is
a nightmare, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tamiami Trail</ENAMEX> about 10 miles south of the crash site,
dozens of private airboat owners lined the road volunteering their
services to rescue workers. By nightfall, though, authorities had
sent them home, and police were turning away visitors.
<p>
   Rescue and recovery workers were setting up camp <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>
near the site along the levee of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">L-67 Canal</ENAMEX>, hanging mosquito
netting and lights from their boats as they settled in for the
night.
<p>
   At <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami International Airport</ENAMEX>, about 50 or 60 family members of
Flight 592 passengers arrived in the first 2{ hours after the crash
and were shepherded to a private area where counselors and clergy
were on hand.
<p>
   It was the first crash of a commercial flight arriving or
departing at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami International</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1972</TIMEX>, when an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Airlines</ENAMEX> L-1011 crashed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX> approaching the
airport and 101 of 176 aboard were killed.
<p>
   It was the first fatal accident involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> since the
bargain airline began operations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1993</TIMEX>.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> has had several safety problems <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over the last year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>, an engine fire spread through the fuselage of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>
plane on the runway at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hartsfield International Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>,
burning a flight attendant and destroying the plane.
<p>
   Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>, three <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> planes have run off runways in bad
weather, and two planes have been knocked out of service after hard
landings. There were no injuries in any of those incidents.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-based carrier began with two used planes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> and
has expanded to about 50. But it announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> it would take
a break from its rapid growth ``to concentrate on its product
integrity prior to the commencement of the Olympic Games,'' the
airline said.
<p>
   ``This decision has been made, in part, in response to increased
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>) scrutiny and requirements relating to the company that
resulted from recent incidents involving the company's aircraft,''
the airline said at the time.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 13</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX> stocks climbed to a
record high as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX>, parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX>, rose in the
wake of the crash of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet Inc.</ENAMEX> DC-9 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The Bloomberg Colorado Stock Index rose 0.86, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.61 percent</NUMEX>,
to 141.07. Advancers outnumbered decliners 48 to 35 in the
price-weighted index that tracks shares of companies with
operations in the state.
<p>
   In the broader <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> stock market, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
Index rose 9.42, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.44 percent</NUMEX>, to 661.51. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average climbed 64.46, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.17 percent</NUMEX>, to 5582.60.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> rose 6, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.8 percent</NUMEX>, to 214, as the stocks of major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
airlines registered their biggest one-day advance in almost a
month. The S&AMP;P airline index rose 12.37 to 344.53, with investors
favoring established carriers over recent start-ups.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> is included in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>'s index because of its dominant
position in the state's economy.
<p>
   Investors said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>'s crash of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> DC-9 in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida
Everglades</ENAMEX> cast a pall over the ability of fledgling airlines to
raise sufficient capital to replace older jets. The crash killed
109 people. ``People have been able to get financing fairly
readily,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Ray</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gerald L. Ray &AMP; Associates</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>
money management firm that oversees <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500 million</NUMEX> in assets. ``It
will be interesting to see what the capital markets say about all
this.''
<p>
   Among those carriers that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray</ENAMEX> is watching is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado
Springs</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Pacific Airlines Inc.</ENAMEX>, which fell 3/4 to 15
3/4 to lead the state's declining issues. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Pacific</ENAMEX> hopes to
add eight aircraft to its 14-plane fleet by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">end of 1996</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frontier Airlines Inc.</ENAMEX>, which fell 3/4 to 7 5/8, is
also growing. The airline, which marks its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">second anniversary</TIMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, is putting its eighth and ninth aircraft into service <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this
summer</TIMEX>, and hopes to add at least a couple more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this
year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The state's other airline, cargo carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlas Air Inc.</ENAMEX>, fell
7/16 to 53 13/16.
<p>
   Other advancing stocks included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin Corp.</ENAMEX>, up 2 n1/8
at 83 1/4; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amrion Inc.</ENAMEX>, up 1 1/2 at 18 5/8; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exabyte Corp.</ENAMEX>, up 5/8
at 20 5/8; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newmont Mining Corp.</ENAMEX>, up 5/8 at 59 1/8. Other
declining issues included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Chicken Inc.</ENAMEX>, off 5/8 at 35 7/8,
even though it reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first-quarter</TIMEX> profit doubled.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adolph Coors Co.</ENAMEX> fell 7/16 to 17 13/16, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FirstMiss Gold
Corp.</ENAMEX>, dropped 3/8 to 37 5/8.
<p>
   The Colorado index has gained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.62 percent</NUMEX> since the first of
the year, compared with the S&AMP;P 500's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.40 percent</NUMEX> advance.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MIAMI</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Undaunted by a hostile environment, crash scene
investigators extracted a flight data recorder and dozens of body
parts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> from the marshy grave of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> Flight 592.
<p>
   The discovery marked the first real victory for recovery crews
since the aircraft nosedived into a desolate expanse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida
Everglades</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days ago</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> investigators said the
``black box,'' which was in the powder-blue tail of the DC-9
aircraft, was located during a plotted-grid search of the crash
site.
<p>
   The flight data recorder measures altitude, speed and
acceleration of the aircraft at the time of an accident. The device
will be taken to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> laboratory in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> where it will be
analyzed for clues to the cause of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>'s crash.
<p>
   Search crews are still looking for a second recorder which is
designed to capture the conversations in the cockpit.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-bound plane crashed roughly nine minutes after
takeoff from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>'s airport with 104 passengers and five crew
members. The flight crew reported smoke in the cockpit and cabin
before the tower lost contact.
<p>
   While a marksman atop an airboat scanned for alligators and
poisonous water moccasins, five teams of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro-Dade police</ENAMEX> divers
took turns wading through the waist-deep soup of water and muck.
The walked gingerly, groping with their hands and feet for chucks
of debris or remains of victims.
<p>
   The six members of each crew were linked to each other with rope
 &MD;  muck beneath the surface water is soft enough in spots to swallow
trespassers. Gooey and black, the muck is full of decaying plant
material. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Florida Water Management District</ENAMEX> specialists at
the site measured muck at 3-5 feet deep with 12-18 inches of water
atop.
<p>
   Like archaeologists working a dig, the investigators marked the
search area in square plots.
<p>
   The site, sandwiched between two canals, is just east of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miccosukee Indian Reservation</ENAMEX> and nine miles from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Route 41</ENAMEX>. It is
roughly 16 miles northwest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> airport runway.
<p>
   Helicopters shuttle searchers to the site, where they work in
shifts of about 20 minutes. They wear hazardous-material gear and
masks and tightly tape pant legs and shirt sleeves for added
protection against irritating jet fuel and bacteria in the water.
At the end of each shift, the teams remove their dive suits and
drop them in barrels of disinfectants.
<p>
   Investigators said they have little hope of finding any intact
bodies. The aircraft reportedly plunged into the marshland at a
75-degree angle at an estimated speed of 500 mph.
<p>
   About 40 body parts were recovered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>  &MD;  nothing larger than
a knee. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, seven body bags of remains were loaded onto
an airboat normally used for everglades tours and taken to a levee
where emergency vehicles and vans from the medical examiners office
assemble.
<p>
   As the grim search progressed, federal transportation officials
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> provided new details about the stepped-up scrutiny of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> had been reviewing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s
operations since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> because of a series of problem flights.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>'s crash prompted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> officials to begin a month of
intensive inspections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s maintenance plants and cockpit
procedures.
<p>
   Inspectors are visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s 29 field maintenance
facilities where mechanics handle minor repairs and make sure
planes are ready for their next flight. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> also wants to check
work at six contractor maintenance facilities used by the airline.
Among them: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aero Thrust</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>, where engine repairs are made,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aero Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake City</ENAMEX>, which handles airframe work, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabre
Tech</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The crash has sparked questions about the age of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s
fleet. The DC-9 that crashed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> was 27 years old. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>
officials suggested <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> that older aircraft can be perfectly
safe because any plane 15 years or older is required to have
frequent inspections.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> was to be investigated as part of
an overall probe being conducted in the wake of the crash by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Transportation</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Transportation</ENAMEX> was looking into the
possibility the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> knew <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> was headed for trouble before the
crash. The network said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the probe.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet Airlines</ENAMEX> stock dropped sharply <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, the first day of
trading since the crash and also the first day of intensified
federal scrutiny of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-based carrier. It closed on the
Nasdaq Stock Market down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.18</NUMEX>} a share at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$13.68</NUMEX>}. This story was
supplemented by wire service material.

<p>
   THE <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EVERGLADES</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  With a government sniper patrolling for
alligators and snakes, 30 divers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> combed the mud and inky
waters of this vast swamp in a gruesome search that yielded one of
the two flight recorders from doomed Flight 592.
<p>
   Federal investigators are hoping the flight-data recorder, also
known as a ``black box,'' will offer clues about the cause of the
crash that took 109 lives <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>, when a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> DC-9
nose-dived into a desolate stretch of saw grass, water and ooze
about 15 miles northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``We're encouraged that we found it and hope we can find the
second one which recorded conversations in the cockpit,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike
Benson</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Rescuers also continued the grim search for bodies. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX>
seven body bags of remains had been removed.
<p>
   ``I don't hold any hope we'll find any recoverable large parts
of people,'' said retired <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dade County</ENAMEX> Medical Examiner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph
Davis</ENAMEX>, who is taking part in the investigation.
<p>
   The flight-data recorder found <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> by divers measures
altitude, speed and acceleration of the aircraft at the time of an
accident. But some investigators believe more significant
information will be contained in the box that recorded the crew's
conversations.
<p>
   Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation
Administration</ENAMEX> was to be investigated as part of an overall probe
being conducted in the wake of the crash by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of

<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> began an intensive review of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>, in which
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> inspectors were to ride in the cockpits and review the

<p>
   President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> said he directed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation</ENAMEX> Secretary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Federico Pena</ENAMEX> to report <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> on the additional measures the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> plan to take to ensure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
airlines ``continue to operate at the highest level of safety.''
<p>
   ``I'm determined to do everything I can to make sure American
aviation is the safest in the world,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Although officials were buoyed by retrieving the flight-data
recorder, officials from a widening array of civilian and military
agencies remained stymied about how to retrieve pieces of the
airliner from what one investigator called the most difficult scene
ever encountered for recovering a large passenger plane.
<p>
   ``We're going to have to be prepared for the fact that this may
take us some time,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Francis</ENAMEX>, vice chairman of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> would not say whether investigators might ultimately
have to leave victims and large portions of the plane entombed in
the swamp, which sucked the entire airliner into its murky depths.
<p>
   But the problems associated with retrieving the submerged craft
from a site more than 300 yards from the nearest road mounted even
as new plans for recovery were considered.
<p>
   ``At any accident site you end up leaving something, you never
recover every single part,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said investigators and salvage crews haven't ruled out
any option for retreiving the wreckage. Nevertheless, an early plan
to build a new road to the scene of the crash has been frowned upon
because of environmental considerations.
<p>
   Although the federally protected <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades National Park</ENAMEX>  &MD;  home
to rare animals, birds and plants  &MD;  is posing unprecedented hurdles
to government salvage crews, it is considered environmentally
fragile due in part to pollution from nearby sugar cane farms.
<p>
   A plan to build an artificial dam around the crash site, so that
water can be drained from the area around the wreckage, has also
met with skeptisim. Local geologists say the rock underlying the
swamp is so porous that water would inevitably seep back into the
site.
<p>
   Other potential recovery plans include construction of a
floating staging area near the wreckage and the erection of
temporay bridging from the nearest roadways.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Navy</ENAMEX> salvage experts arrived began searching for the
flight-data recorder with an underwater listening device called a
hydrophone to try picking up radio signals emitted from the data
recorder.
<p>
   The box has a ``pinger'' that transmits a signal for 30 days.
But the signal would be activated only if the data recorder rests
in water and may be impossible to pick up if the box is covered in
mud.
<p>
   ``The equipment is designed for ocean operations, not for swamp
operations,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg Geisen</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> spokesman at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>.
He added that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> personnel on the scene ``don't know the terrain.
They're still trying to assess if they can even possibly assist.''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> salvage experts include the head of diving and salvage
operations at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy Sea Systems Command</ENAMEX> and a civilian expert
from the firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oceaneering Technologies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maryland</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Federal officials <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> also continued to paint a harrowing
picture of the aircraft's passengers and crew, which encountered
smoke in both the cockpit and cabin before the plane plunged into
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX> at an estimated speed of more than 500 m.p.h.
<p>
   The crew, speaking with great urgency just minutes after leaving
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami International Airport</ENAMEX>, made its last transmission at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:13
p.m.</TIMEX>, asking air traffic controllers for the location of the
airport  &MD;  then failed to respond when the information was given.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> investigator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg Feith</ENAMEX> said it was impossible to say
whether the crew was conscious.
<p>
   Meanwhile, the recovery of human remains continued with urgency,
due to rapid decomposition caused by subtropical weather, swamp
bacteria and spilled fuel.
<p>
   Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Mittelman</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dade County</ENAMEX> medical examiner, said the
largest remain recovered so far was a knee. He said his office
would rely on heart pacemakers, teeth, fingerprints, tatooed skin
and DNA tests to identify the bodies. He said officials also would
test for the presence of carbon dioxide in the remains, which could
indicate whether the cabin was on fire when the plane went down.
<p>
   Many high level officials were giving much credit to the divers
who, because of the jet fuel and other contaminants in the water,
taped themselves into airtight protective body wrap before donning
rubber suits to work 20-minute shifts in water with near-zero
visibility.
<p>
   For the most part, officials said, divers searched blindly for
bodies and wreckage using their hands, feet and long poles.
<p>
   ``It's not the most efficient of operations,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said.
``It's tough going.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Candalyn ``Candi'' Chamberlin Kubeck</ENAMEX> was apparently the first
female captain killed in a commercial airline crash, and one of
only a few female commercial pilots killed in a crash, other pilots
said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Pilots, friends and family praised <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubeck</ENAMEX> and her co-pilot,
First Officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Sherrill Hazen</ENAMEX>, as experienced and ``very
safety conscious,'' with excellent flying records. They were among
the 109 killed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 592 plummeted
into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida Everglades</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   One of the only other female pilots killed on duty in a
commercial crash was the co-pilot of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> 737 that
crashed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colo.</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beverly Bass</ENAMEX>, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> captain and founder of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Society
of Women Airline Pilots</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubeck</ENAMEX> had been involved in two previous aircraft incidents as
pilot, neither of them serious, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX>
records show.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1991</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubeck</ENAMEX> was flying a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fairchild</ENAMEX> Metro 3
twin-engine turboprop for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Airways Inc.</ENAMEX>, a now-defunct
sightseeing and commuter airline that operated between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Grand Canyon Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Upon landing at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Grand Canyon Airport</ENAMEX>, the propeller of the
aircraft's left engine struck a deer on the runway. There were no
injuries and no significant damage to the aircraft, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> records
show.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 2, 1994</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubeck</ENAMEX> was piloting another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas</ENAMEX>
DC-9 for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> when the plane skidded sideways on a wet runway
during a landing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, records show.
<p>
   There were no injuries, but the jet had to be towed to the gate,
records show.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> records show that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubeck</ENAMEX> passed a checkride in a simulator
after the incident, scoring a ``high grade.'' No <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> enforcement
action was taken against her for her performance during the skid,
although the incident report indicated that she had failed to
maintain directional control of the aircraft.
<p>
   Each of the earlier events involving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubeck</ENAMEX> was classified by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> as an ``air carrier incident,'' rather than the more
serious ``accident.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubeck</ENAMEX>, a 35-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> native, lived with her
airline-captain husband in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX> and maintained an apartment in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bedford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, where she was based at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas/Fort Worth Airport</ENAMEX>.
She was first licensed as a pilot in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX> at age 17 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Encinitas</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> suburb.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1983</TIMEX>, in the wake of President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>'s firing of
striking air traffic controllers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubeck</ENAMEX> became a controller in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Paso Airport</ENAMEX> control tower, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> said. She left that job in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX> to pursue a career as a professional pilot.
<p>
   She had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> licenses as an air-transport pilot, certificated
flight instructor (airplane and instrument) and control-tower
operator, and had ratings to fly single- and multiengine airplanes.
She was qualified to fly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beech</ENAMEX> 1900, DC-9 and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fairchild</ENAMEX> Metro 3 aircraft.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubeck</ENAMEX> had 8,805 flight hours, including 5,388 hours as a
captain or pilot in command, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> officials reported. Since
joining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1993</TIMEX>, she had accumulated 2,073 flight
hours with the airline, including 1,697 as a captain in the DC-9.
<p>
   She last passed the required annual first-class pilot's medical
exam <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 12</TIMEX>, records show.
<p>
   As a pilot, she was ``very experienced, very well-trained, very
competent,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Jordan</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazen</ENAMEX>, 52, was also assigned to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D/FW</ENAMEX> base, from which
the airline operates as many as five daily round trips to its main
hub, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hartsfield Airport</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazen</ENAMEX>, a retired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> pilot, had 6,146 flight hours. He
lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mineola</ENAMEX>, a small city northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tyler</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Texas</ENAMEX>,
and had been flying for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>, a family spokesman
said.
<p>
   He previously worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX> and for an airline
taking tourists to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>, said his stepdaughter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimberly Reedy</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Irving</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> records show that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazen</ENAMEX> had an air-transport pilot's
license, as well as a flight engineer's certificate. His ratings
included single- and multiengine aircraft, and he passed the
first-class medical exam in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1995</TIMEX>.
<p>
   As a pilot, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazen</ENAMEX> was ``very safety conscious,'' son-in-law <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc
Reedy</ENAMEX> said. ``He was proud of his safety record and proud to be a
pilot.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimberly Reedy</ENAMEX> said the tragedy is ``hard to believe.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazen</ENAMEX>
used to take her for rides in his two-seat plane and ``just fly
around for fun.''
<p>
   ``He loved to fly,'' she said. ``That was what he always wanted
to do.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">LOS ANGELES</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Chamberlin</ENAMEX> never had any worries about his
daughter's well-being while she piloted commercial jets.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Candalyn ``Candi'' Kubeck</ENAMEX>, her father said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, was an
experienced aviator who turned a childhood love for airplanes into
a career that won her family's admiration.
<p>
   ``She was such a careful pilot, which is why I think it was the
equipment on Flight 592,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chamberlin</ENAMEX>, a resident of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Encino</ENAMEX> section of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. ``I think that something electrical
probably flooded the cockpit with toxic fumes ... Nothing could be
done.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubeck</ENAMEX>, believed to be the first woman commercial jetliner
captain to die in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> crash, was among 104 passengers and five
crew members killed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> when her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> plane crashed into
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida Everglades</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-bound DC-9 crashed shortly after takeoff from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>.
The crew radioed urgently about smoke in the cockpit and cabin
before the tower lost contact.
<p>
   The crash and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubeck</ENAMEX>'s death has left her family devastated.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubeck</ENAMEX>, who first entered a major airline cockpit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>,
turned 35 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chamberlin</ENAMEX> said he and his wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan</ENAMEX>, had
planned to take their daughter to see ``Beauty and the Beast'' in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> to celebrate.
<p>
   ``We were overwhelmed by this event, this tragedy,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chamberlin</ENAMEX>
said. ``She loved to fly. She expressed so much intelligence and so
much love. Those are the things that will be with us.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubeck</ENAMEX>'s husband, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Kubeck</ENAMEX>, is a pilot with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American West
Airlines</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Family members say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Candi Kubeck</ENAMEX> was captivated by the military
aircraft she saw in the skies while growing up in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern
California</ENAMEX>. She hoped to fly, just like her grandfather who flew
biplanes during World War I.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubeck</ENAMEX> studied at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berkeley Hall School</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bel-Air</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palomar College</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Marcos</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   She graduated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan State College</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX>, where
she studied aviation and competed in a flight team that challenged
teams from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force Academy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   She began her career as a pilot instructor at small airfields
and working at various commuter and freight airlines. Her career
breakthrough came in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, when she crossed the picket lines at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Airlines</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chamberlin</ENAMEX>, a management consultant, said the airlines' training
facilities were among the best in the industry, and his daughter
learned to fly some of the nation's largest and most modern jets,
including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX>'s biggest plane, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airbus</ENAMEX> 300.
<p>
   She was hired in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chamberlin</ENAMEX> said his daughter never expressed safety concerns at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>, but recalled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubeck</ENAMEX> noting that some of the fleet had
reached a ``pretty senior age.''
<p>
   He said she was excited about the company's recent orders for
new planes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas Corp.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> DC-9 that crashed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> was 27 years old.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrice King</ENAMEX>, who is setting up a scholarship fund in her
stepsister's memory, said flying was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubeck</ENAMEX>'s ``lifelong passion.''
<p>
   ``We feel that the scholarship fund is something that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Candi</ENAMEX>
would like to have done, to help others live out her dream,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX>
said.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubecks</ENAMEX> were married for eight years and have no children.
<p>
   Her family has established the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Candi Chamberlin Kubeck

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Two weeks before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> Flight 592 carried its 109
passengers to their deaths in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX>, federal auditors
reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX>'s airplane safety
checks lacked some of the basic elements of a common automobile
inspection.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> responded to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> crash with a plan
to hire more inspectors quickly, those same examiners cautioned
again that the agency should also change its inspection and
training procedures to make the skies safer. Congressional critics
echoed their remarks.
<p>
   During an aircraft check before a flight, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> inspectors are not
required to check vital equipment, such as the landing gear and
engine, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond J. DeCarli</ENAMEX>, an assistant inspector general for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Department of Transportation</ENAMEX>. ``Can you imagine taking your
car in for an inspection and having the brakes and tires checked <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50
percent</NUMEX> of the time?'' he asked. ``There's no checklist of what
they have to inspect.'' An inspector ``can do virtually nothing and
it's considered an inspection.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeCarli</ENAMEX>'s spoke as some congressional lawmakers called for more
scrutiny of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> inspection procedures and questioned whether the
agency is too cozy with the industry it is assigned to watch. The
inspector general's office also said it would investigate reports,
first aired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC News</ENAMEX>, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> encouraged inspectors to ``go
soft'' on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Lawmakers said the various investigations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>
would bring new urgency to a debate over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s structure and
funding. Some critics want to strip the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> of its mission of
promoting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> air travel industry, saying it cannot nurture
young airlines or aircraft manufacturers and ensure safety at the
same time.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeCarli</ENAMEX>'s comments, made in a phone interview, echoed his
testimony before a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> subcommittee <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 30</TIMEX>, in which he said
that training, personnel-testing and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> procedures were
inadequate.
<p>
   For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeCarli</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> failed to crack down on the
use of unapproved parts in airplane repair. Moreover, a study by
his office showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> workers checked landing gear in only <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48
percent</NUMEX> of their preflight plane inspections. They checked the
engines <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52 percent</NUMEX> of the time and engine controls a third of the
time.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeCarli</ENAMEX>'s report was one basis for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> magazine essay by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Fackler Schiavo</ENAMEX>, inspector general for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation</ENAMEX>, in
which she said she has skipped conferences rather than fly on
``marginal airlines.'' She said she avoids flying on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>
because of a history of ``mishaps.''
<p>
   Those comments alarmed lawmakers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Wyden</ENAMEX>, a Democrat from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon</ENAMEX>, called it ``troubling''
and ``bizarre situation when the inspector general says they don't
feel comfortable flying an airline that is out flying planes and
offering its services to the American public.''
<p>
   At a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> hearing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, scheduled long before the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> crash, other lawmakers said they were hesitant to comment
on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> procedures without knowing the cause of the accident. Sen.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Stevens</ENAMEX>, a Republican from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>, criticized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX> for
``destroying confidence'' in air safety. ``I suggest the president
has the right to remove an inspector general for dereliction of
duty,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike McCurry</ENAMEX> said there was no talk of
removing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX> from her job.
<p>
   At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Transportation Committee</ENAMEX> hearing, top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>
officials said they would take three steps to improve safety:
<p>
    &MD; Speed the hiring of 91 inspectors by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">end of June</TIMEX> who were
due to be hired by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>. The agency has already hired 140
inspectors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> and has asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> for 150 more in its
next budget. It has about 2,500 inspectors.
<p>
    &MD;  Speeding up introduction of a system that tracks inspection
data and flags dangerous conditions.
<p>
    &MD;  Reviewing the work that inspectors do to make sure they focus
on top priorities.
<p>
   Separately, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> issued an emergency order <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> suspending
flight operations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCL Aviation Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AvAtlantic</ENAMEX> because of
``discrepancies in the training, testing and qualifications of
flight attendants.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AvAtlantic</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Savannah</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ga.</ENAMEX>, leases
planes to the presidential campaign of Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX>, which said it
expects no interruption in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>'s travel schedule.
<p>
   Even before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> crash, lawmakers had been wrestling with
how to improve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>. Plans to change the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s dual mission
could generate the biggest debate in the next few months.
<p>
   As part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> administration's efforts to boost <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX>
exports, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Federico Pena</ENAMEX> and FAA
administrator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hinson</ENAMEX> have traveled overseas to help sell
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX>-made airplanes. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> is also charged with making sure
those planes are safe.
<p>
   ``There is an inherent conflict in those two missions,'' said
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William S. Cohen</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX> Republican.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> administrator, said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that the air system
is safe and improving. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> had the same accident
rate today as in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>, he said, a fatal air crash would occur every
10 days. ``When we say an airline is safe to fly, it is safe to
fly,'' he said. ''There is no gray area.''
<p>
   At the same time, though, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> budget of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8.6 billion</NUMEX> is down
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$600 million</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> has lost 5,100 workers, a cut
of about <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony J. Broderick</ENAMEX>, associate administrator
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that the level of worker training has
decreased significantly, ``and quite frankly, I think it's too deep
a decrease.'' The agency has requested a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 percent</NUMEX> increase in its
training budget for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Complicating matters, the agency has lost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$550 million</NUMEX> in
monthly revenue because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, amid the impasse over the federal
budget, has not renewed a 20-year-old tax on airplane tickets and
cargo. Plans to revive the tax are tangled in a debate over the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s structure and a controversial plan to replace the tax with
user fees to be paid by airlines. Several big airlines favor user
fees, but low-fare carriers say it would force them to raise
prices.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WEST PALM BEACH</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  ``I'm traveling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>
flight with an extemely fearful flier,'' begins the note posted
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> in a computer forum on aviation safety.
<p>
   ``The ticket agent told me it was an MD-88 and I was hoping
someone here could provide us with a little info about exactly what
kind of aircraft that is and what its track record has been.''
<p>
   Relax, about two dozen people have since told the writer: the
planes have an outstanding safety record.
<p>
   ``Tell your friend to expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> to provide her with a safe
and on-time journey,'' one wrote.
<p>
   Places like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CompuServe</ENAMEX>'s Aviation Safety Interest Group, a
longtime gathering point for pilots and aviation buffs  &MD;  and
several sites on the Internet  &MD;  can arm you with a lot of
information about airplane models, crash records and other data.
<p>
   But can you find out if the plane you're catching <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> has
had a lot of maintenance problems? Or whether it's one of the
models for which the government, eager to prevent smoky fires, has
started requiring new cockpit wiring?
<p>
   A phone call to the airline can get you the model scheduled for
your flight and perhaps the age of the plane, but not much else.
<p>
   Even if you can extract the plane's tail number from a customer
service agent, searching aviation databases ``is not for someone
who doesn't have a lot of patience,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Overly</ENAMEX> (CQ) ,
research director for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aviation Safety Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Columbus</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   And once you had the records and are reassured your plane's in
fine shape, you could find the airline had to make a substitution.
<p>
   A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> spokesman said a daily flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Palm Beach</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charlotte</ENAMEX>, for example, could get any of the airline's 34 757s,
depending on weather delays, scheduled maintenance and other
factors.
<p>
   ``The airline usually will fly the same type of plane,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Loucks</ENAMEX>, spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Society of Travel Agents</ENAMEX>.
``But there's no real way to pinpoint which piece of aircraft
you'll be traveling on.''
<p>
   If you're seeking information on the model, as the woman curious
about the MD-88 was, several sites on the World Wide Web can help.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> is a good starting point,
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s weekly summary of airport and airline incidents,
known as service difficulty reports, and equipment notices called
airworthiness directives.
<p>
   And Internet news groups and aviation forums such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CompuServe</ENAMEX>'s can offer useful advice, such as thinking of
turbulence ``like the wake from a boat'' and comparing changes in
engine pitch with the sounds a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greyhound</ENAMEX> bus moter makes while
climbing and descending hills.

<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MIAMI</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Crash investigators on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> began analyzing technical
information from the single ``black box'' recovered so far from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> DC-9 that crashed near here on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> and began
reassembling parts of the plane in a hangar at a small airport
nearby.
<p>
   Investigators are still searching for the second black box. In
addition, they are trying to figure out how to pull the wreckage
from the main crater the plane made in the mud under the shallow
water of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX>. They met here on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> to work on that
problem with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army Corps of Engineers</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Navy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>
officials and private engineering companies. The crater is about
130 feet long and 40 to 50 feet wide; no one knows its depth.
<p>
   In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> the secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transportation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Federico Pena</ENAMEX>,
reported to President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> on steps the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation
Administration</ENAMEX> would take ``to insure that the nation's civil
aviation system remains the safest in the world.''
<p>
   He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> would accelerate an existing plan to hire more
inspectors and would work harder to track the status of problems
its inspectors uncover. For years the agency has been criticized by
auditors from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> for what
they call sloppy record keeping that makes it harder to spot
dangerous trends and for the agency's inspection procedures.
<p>
   But whether the steps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pena</ENAMEX> discussed would have prevented the
crash is unclear because no one yet knows why the cockpit and cabin
filled with smoke and the plane crashed, killing all 109 people
aboard.
<p>
   At the crash scene, about 12 miles west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>
metropolitan area, the searchers have been working
shoulder-to-shoulder in a carefully organized grid. Dressed in
special protective suits and slogging through several feet of water
and subsurface muck, they have been able to work only 20 to 30
minutes at a time in the 90-degree weather before coming out to
rest, cool off and be decontaminated from the jet fuel and possible
pathogens in the human remains in the water.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Francis</ENAMEX>, the vice chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation
Safety Board</ENAMEX>, said at a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mid-day</TIMEX> briefing that most of the plane
parts found had originally been in the tail of the jet, but, like
the human remains, had been discovered south of the main crater,
farther along the route of flight. The tail is where both of the
black boxes were situated.
<p>
   The box that has been found was the flight-data recorder, which
collects information on altitude, heading, speed, horizontal and
vertical acceleration and engine function. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said that the
box was dented but that its magnetic tapes had recorded ``good
data.''
<p>
   But the box will not provide information on many individual
parts of the plane, and reading its information will be a little
like watching an opera in a foreign language, providing only a
gross approximation of what happened.
<p>
   On the other hand, the other box, the cockpit voice recorder,
could contain ``a magic bullet,'' a statement by the captain or
first officer that would make clear what happened, said one safety
board official. People at the safety board said they could not
remember a case in which one box had been recovered but the other
had not.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> also spoke about the reassembly of the plane in a hangar
nearby. In crash investigations, engineers often lay out on the
floor of a hangar the mechanical pieces of the plane they recover.
This helps them keep track of what has been found, what is missing
and how the plane has been damaged. In this inquiry, not enough
parts have yet been found to draw conclusions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Of the aircraft parts found so far, none shows obvious signs of
fire or smoke, searchers said. The co-pilot of the plane reported
smoke in the cockpit and cabin shortly before the crash.
<p>
   Searchers have not found the air-conditioning packs, which are
devices powered by the jet engines that pressurize air for the
cabin and are one possible source of smoke. But there are many
other potential sources of smoke, experts say, including electrical
wiring. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said some wiring had been found and would be
closely scrutinized.
<p>
   Wiring in old planes like this one, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>, has long been
a concern, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> said on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that a new
rule would take effect on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> to require that DC-9's and
other planes made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas Corp.</ENAMEX> be inspected for
chafed wiring in the cockpit. On some planes, but not DC-9's, that
condition has caused smoke.
<p>
   As salvage operations proceed, investigators will also be
looking for circuit breakers for the fuel pumps. A malfunction in
these circuit breakers caused a lengthy delay in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, before
the plane took off for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> in its last successful flight. There
is no immediate indication that this problem had any relationship
to the crash when it took off for the return trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> continued to defer questions on the crash to
the safety board, an independent agency that takes charge of plane
accident investigations. The crash is a blow for the aviation
administration, which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early this year</TIMEX> identified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> as
requiring additional attention and blitzed the young airline with
hundreds of inspections in a one-week period in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>
officials say they found no violations significant enough to
require enforcement action, but they did make numerous suggestions,
to which, they said, the airline voluntarily responded.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Schiavo</ENAMEX>, the inspector general of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of
Transportation</ENAMEX>, which is the parent agency of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>
that she would look into whether the investigators had been too
easy on the airline.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 15</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation
Administration</ENAMEX> said it is launching an ``intensive 30-day review''
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet Airlines</ENAMEX> operations following the crash of the discount
airline's Flight 592 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX>, which killed 109
people.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> administrator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hinson</ENAMEX>, who announced the review at a
news conference <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX>, said the agency still considers
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> ``safe to fly.''
<p>
   ``The additional inspections we are doing are additional safety
margins and should be viewed as such.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Broderick</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s associate administrator for regulation
and certification, said the review would involve ``five specific
steps'' in which the agency would:
<p>
   -- Review all reports of mechanical problems filed within the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past 12 months</TIMEX> to insure they have been corrected.
<p>
   -- Inspect all aircraft the morning after they have undergone
overnight repairs.
<p>
   -- Put <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> inspectors on every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> plane for weekly
in-flight inspections. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> has ``at least 350 flights weekly
and we'd like them on as many as possible,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broderick</ENAMEX> said of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> inspectors.
<p>
   -- Reinspect all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s maintenance stations at operations
centers away from the airline's main repair facilities.
<p>
   -- Conduct ``top to bottom inspections'' of every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> plane
that has undergone heavy maintenance.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> Flight 592 crashed as the pilot and first officer were
attempting an emergency landing of the 27-year-old, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell
Douglas</ENAMEX>-built DC-9 jetliner back to Mi
<p>
   QIreporting smoke in the cockpit and passenger cabin.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last night</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>, which is
directing the accident investigation, said an explosion could have
torn through the jetliner, triggering a sudden loss of speed and
altitude.
<p>
   A flight recorder recovered by police divers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> indicated
the DC-9 had a flight ``anomaly'' 3 1/2 minutes before the crash,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Francis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> vice chairman, said in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Additionally, two parts of the plane were discovered, marked
with ``apparent soot,'' and that suggested ``there could have been
an explosion,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   While no cause has been pinpointed, accident investigators were
studying the possibility that the blast may have been related to
50-60 surplus aircraft oxygen generators shipped in the aircraft's
cargo hold.
<p>
   The generators, which had exceeded their shelf life, were being
shipped to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s headquarters in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   It wasn't immediately clear <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last night</TIMEX> whether shipping the
generators was contrary to government regulations.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX> declined to answer a question on that point, although he
did say that ``some hazardous material is allowed on airplanes
under proper circumstances.''
<p>
   In trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> shares were at 14 5/8, down 3/8.
Shares had fallen as much as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 percent</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, the first
trading session after the crash, to 11 3/4.
<p>
   Following the crash, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> expanded a 120-day investigation of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s flight operations, training and maintenance procedures.
The inquiry was prompted by several mishaps, including a fire <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last
year</TIMEX> that destroyed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> DC-9 on a runway in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> and
injured several people.
<p>
   The airline has one of the oldest jet fleets in the sky, and has
drawn criticism from the inspector general of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation
Department</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Schiavo</ENAMEX>. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Jordan</ENAMEX>
has defended the airline's safety standards, saying: ``We cannot
put too much emphasis on safety --ever.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WEST PALM BEACH</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Half an hour after a mechanic jostled an
oxygen-generating canister aboard a grounded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas</ENAMEX>
DC-10, the airplane began smoldering and then erupted into flames.
<p>
   Although no one was injured, flames destroyed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Trans
Air</ENAMEX> jetliner shortly after it arrived from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Honolulu</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 10,
1986</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A decade later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>
investigators are exploring whether a similar fire could have
caused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> 592 to crash into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX>, killing all 110
(CQ) people on board.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s cargo manifest listed five crates containing 50 to 60
of the stainless steel canisters that produce oxygen for emergency
masks. The devices were stowed near three inflated aircraft spare
tires.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Francis</ENAMEX>, the board's vice chairman, said the oxygen
generators may have exploded in the forward cargo hold.
<p>
   Such an explosion could account for why the air speed and
altimeter registered information that conflicted with radar reports
of how fast and how high the plane was traveling, chief
investigator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory Feith</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Similarly, the aircraft tires pose a potential problem for
in-air explosion. Former safety board chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Burnett</ENAMEX>
described the aircraft tires as ``very dangerous to be around
because they are under very high pressure  &MD;  if you are around one
when it blows it can kill you.''
<p>
   Sometimes tires that are part of the landing gear explode while
in flight but they do not damage the aircraft because a special
shield in the wheel well protects the aircraft, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burnett</ENAMEX> said.
However, the cargo hold lacks such shielding, he said.
<p>
   ``I've heard of tires exploding in the wheel well, but never ran
across the issue of them being transported in the cargo,'' he said.
``I rather suspect that's because they don't do it.''
<p>
   Other safety board officials registered concern about proper use
of oxygen generating systems as early as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``The potential for serious injuries and fatalities is great,''
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> report said then, noting recurring problems with the
systems that chemically generate oxygen on DC-10s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX>
1011s.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Transportation</ENAMEX> classifies the oxygen
generators as hazardous materials when carried as company material
in cargo compartments. They should be packaged and stowed securely.
<p>
   Just as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> case, oxygen generators were stowed in
the forward cargo compartment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Trans Air</ENAMEX> plane what
was demolished in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> fire <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years ago</TIMEX>. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Trans
Air</ENAMEX> mechanic apparently set off the fire that destroyed the DC-10
while attempting to fix an oxygen compartment door that would not
close.
<p>
   ``He found a loose oxygen canister and handled it improperly by
its oxygen hose,'' according to a safety board account of the fire.
That released the firing pin, which in turn fired the percussion
cap and triggered a chemical reaction that generated oxygen.
<p>
   Improper handling of the oxygen generating canisters -- such as
inadvertently releasing the firing pin -- can trigger a chemical
reaction and generate oxygen, which generates heat up to 430
degrees outside the canister. That's hot enough to explode hydrogen
and automatically inflate air bags in vehicle fires. Volcanic
eruptions that throw off ash and steam reach just over 400 degrees.
<p>
   The fire aboard <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Trans Air</ENAMEX> began shortly after the
aircraft completed a flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Honolulu</ENAMEX>. The passengers and crew
had deplaned the cleaning crew entered, noting the cabin was
initially cold and grew ``uncomfortably hot'' within minutes.
Within the next 30 minutes gray smoke began billowing in the
passenger cabin, forcing the cleaning crew to evacuate.
<p>
   ``The smoke grew darker and rapidly intensified,'' according to
a safety board account of the fire.
<p>
   The cabin then burst into fire, destroying the entire aircraft.
The fire ignited seat covers, burned through the cabin floor and
spread throughout the entire cabin.
<p>
   After the fire investigators tested a similar oxygen canister to
determine whether it could generate enough heat to cause the fire.
They wrapped the canister in a paper laboratory coat and pulled the
canister's pin. The coat ignited and burned.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MIAMI</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> Flight 592, which crashed here on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>
apparently after an explosion and fire on board, may have been
carrying highly reactive chemicals because an inexperienced
shipping clerk did not recognize them as hazardous materials,
according to people involved in the investigation.
<p>
   The chemicals were in canisters called oxygen generators, which
are used to supply emergency masks with oxygen. A maintenance
contractor had removed the canisters from another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> plane at
the airline's request and delivered them back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>. An
employee of the contractor packed the canisters in boxes and
labeled the boxes ``empty,'' a notation that ordinarily would refer
to the canisters, not the boxes.
<p>
   Investigators now believe that the canisters may have been full
and consider them a leading suspect in the crash. Even if the
canisters were empty, they still might have required more secure
packaging, according to aviation experts.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth P. Quinn</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for the maintenance contractor,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SabreTech</ENAMEX>, said: ``It is unclear whether the employee knew that the
substance in the canisters constituted a hazardous material, and if
so, whether the material had been discharged.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinn</ENAMEX> said that the cannisters, 50 to 60 in all, in five
cardboard boxes, ``were returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> for appropriate
disposal.'' He said a shipping tag on the boxes had two notations:
``empty'' and ``customer furnished material returned per customer
instructions.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinn</ENAMEX> said his company was now investigating
whether the canisters were still full.
<p>
   It is standard practice in the industry for such canisters, when
carried as cargo, to be emptied and packed in strong, airtight
boxes.
<p>
   The chief accident investigator, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory Feith</ENAMEX>, said at a
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mid-day</TIMEX> briefing near the scene of the accident: ``We don't know
what experience the people that were handling these canisters
had.'' He added: ``If you pick up a one pound canister and somebody
says they're off an airplane, they're old, that may have been
interpreted by some to mean something else.''
<p>
   He said: ``There's a terminology problem here that we need to
clarify.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feith</ENAMEX> added: ``We're going to try to identify who actually
handled it, what they saw, what they used to make the evaluation as
to whether they are actually full or not full.''
<p>
   The canisters are not used on DC-9s, the kind of the plane that
crashed. They are used on MD-80s, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> also flies, to make
oxygen for passenger emergency masks. They make oxygen with a
chemical reaction that generates tremendous heat but is safe when
the canisters are installed in a seatback or overhead compartment.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> has found strong
evidence of fire and explosion on the plane, and has found
paperwork on the ground indicating that the oxygen generators were
on board. It has not suggested a mechanism by which a generator or
generators became activated, though, and it is still looking at
wiring and other possible sources of explosion or fire.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SabreTech</ENAMEX> said in a statement on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>: ``We agree with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis
Jordan</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>, that it is premature and
irresponsible to engage in speculation over the probable cause of
this tragic accident. We are cooperating fully with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX>.''
<p>
   Thus far, none of the generators has been recovered. The safety
board hopes to find some in the muck of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX> where the
plane crashed and check their serial numbers against maintenance
records to determine definitively if they were still potent when
shipped.
<p>
   Also on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feith</ENAMEX> contradicted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation
Administration</ENAMEX> and said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> could legally have carried the
generators even though it has chosen not to carry hazardous
materials for others and has not developed the procedures and
trained the personnel as required by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> for such work.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, senior officials of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, who refused to be
publicly named, said that if the airline was not authorized to
handle hazardous materials, then it could not carry the oxygen
generators even if they were what the industry calls ``company
materials.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feith</ENAMEX> said: ``There are provisions that allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> to ship
hazardous material that is necessary for company business.'' He
said: ``This discussion needs to be expanded to find out if in fact
this was being done for company business, and then what regulations
and requirements does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> have to follow when shipping
hazardous materials for their own benefit.''
<p>
   Investigators have recovered the flight data recorder, one of
the plane's ``black boxes,'' and found signs on it consistent with
an explosion on board. They have also found soot-covered wreckage.
In addition, before the plane crashed, the co-pilot reported to the
ground that the cockpit and cabin were filling with smoke. A
possible source of that smoke, according to investigators, was
three aircraft tires from an MD-80, carried with the generators in
the forward cargo compartment.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, searchers used a heavy-duty helicopter to lift
major pieces of the wreckage out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX>, including two
tires, two major landing gear pieces, some pieces of wing and
fuselage, and ``a piece that looks like it's from the rear cargo
bay,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Francis</ENAMEX>, vice chairman of the safety board.
Investigators are not sure whether the tires were cargo or in use
on the plane. Searchers have also recovered both engines, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX>
said.
<p>
   Illustrating the difficulty of recovery, he said that the
helicopter pulled at one engine with a force of 4,000 pounds before
freeing it from the muck; once airborne, it weighed less than
3,000, he said.
<p>
   For the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last two days</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> has been wearing a small green
ribbon marked ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> Flight 592, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11, 1996</TIMEX>.'' The ribbons
were given to dozens of relatives of the victims who have arrived
here to await recovery of body parts.
<p>
   Searchers have not found the cockpit voice recorder, which
investigators badly want.
<p>
   Support organizations, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salvation Army</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fire
Department</ENAMEX>, plan now to be at the scene <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least three to four more
weeks</TIMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salvation Army</ENAMEX> said it was serving about 1,800 meals a
day.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Federal crash investigators said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> that they
had found a partly burned aircraft tire that was carried as cargo
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> DC-9 that crashed near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11</TIMEX>, a likely
source of the smoke that the co-pilot urgently reported just before
the crash. Embedded in the tire, the investigators said, were parts
from at least one oxygen generator, a device that can generate
tremendous heat.
<p>
   The discovery adds substantial weight to a leading theory in the
crash, that one or more generators, which were being carried as
cargo on the flight, somehow activated and ignited the tire.
<p>
   But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>, following its
standard practice, will take months before it formally establishes
what caused the crash, which killed all 110 people aboard when it
slammed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX> a few minutes after takeoff from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami
International Airport</ENAMEX>, bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The investigator in charge, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory Feith</ENAMEX>, said at a briefing
near the crash site that the safety board's staff had determined
through interviews of ground personnel that there were 119 of the
generators on board, double what had previously been suspected, and
that some were stacked on top of one of three tires in the forward
cargo hold.
<p>
   He said the generators, which are each a little bigger than a
coffee thermos, were in cardboard boxes. When carried as cargo they
are supposed to be in air-tight containers, and standard airline
practice is to transport them only after they have been activated
and allowed to run through their chemical reaction, thus
eliminating the possibility that they will produce heat, which can
start fires, and oxygen, which feeds fires, while in a cargo hold.
<p>
   But there is strong suspicion that at least some of the
generators were still potent. They had been removed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months
earlier</TIMEX> from three other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> aircraft, MD-80s being refurbished
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>, and were being returned to the airline by a
maintenance contractor.
<p>
   On MD-80s the generators are used to provide oxygen to passenger
emergency masks, but because the chemicals they use can
deteriorate, each is given an expiration date, and these had
expired.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feith</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> personnel put them aboard the
DC-9 for shipment to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, where the airline has its
headquarters. The distinction may be important because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabertech</ENAMEX>,
the maintenance contractor, contends that whether or not the
generators were hazardous cargo, the airline is responsible for
figuring out what it is loading on its planes.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> officials assert that before the airline put the boxes
aboard the flight, 592, its personnel saw that the labels on the
boxes described the generators as empty.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabertech</ENAMEX> have already begun pointing fingers at
each other, and may eventually do so in court. While the safety
board does not fix blame for accidents, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feith</ENAMEX> has repeatedly used a
legal term in describing one of the chief areas of inquiry: what
the board wants to know about the oxygen generators, he said, is
the ``chain of custody.''
<p>
   The investigators have a lot of other work to do. Many
soot-covered parts have been discovered, and laboratory technicians
will examine the soot to see if it is from rubber or from
electrical wiring, which is another suspect in the crash.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feith</ENAMEX> said that the oxygen generators and the tires were ``a
main focus'' of the investigation, but that it was still too soon
to draw conclusions. ``We have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> of an airplane that is
unaccountable,'' he said, noting that most of it is still under
water or buried in mud.
<p>
   Most of the plane's parts have been found by police officers
wading through the area or by pairs of searchers who lash two
airboats together, about three feet apart, and reach down between
them with their hands, pulling up whatever they find.
<p>
   Investigators have begun using special radar that can see
through the mud, and hope to find the cockpit voice recorder.
<p>
   To look at the main crater dug by the plane when it crashed,
they recently received special diving suits that are designed for
use with hazardous materials. But then they found that the airboats
from which they have been working are too small to carry all the
required diving equipment. The investigators hope to begin the
dives on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feith</ENAMEX> said that investigators had finished reviewing the
maintenance records of the plane and that ``the paperwork was in
order from what they could see.''

<p>
   ``We acknowledge that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SabreTech</ENAMEX> delivered to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> boxes
containing the canisters with a shipping ticket marked as`empty',''
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Reddick</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for shipper's parent company.
``We're certainly concerned about this.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth P. Quinn</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SabreTech</ENAMEX> spokesman in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>, said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late
yesterday</TIMEX> that his company, ``consistent with past practice,''
returned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> materials to the airline for ``appropriate
disposal.''
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> made an independent decision to ship their company
materials on board an aircraft, and apparently did not ensure that
they were properly labeled, packaged and stored,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinn</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> officials said the airline wasn't informed that cargo
flight 592 was hazardous.
<p>
   Hazardous materials experts investigating the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11</TIMEX> crash of
the discount carrier's DC-9 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this
month</TIMEX> found evidence that exploding oxygen canisters in the cargo
hold may have caused the accident, which killed 110 people.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> reported that divers
found metal fragments from oxygen canisters that apparently
exploded and burned before the plane crashed. Five boxes of oxygen
generators were presented for shipment to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> by
non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> employees, and someone filled out the ticket to read:
``5 boxes, oxy canisters empty,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> said in a statement. The
shipment was delivered to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> in boxes without the federally
required hazardous material labeling or any other indication of the
hazardous goods within, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SabreTech</ENAMEX> removed the expired
canisters from three <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> MD-80 aircraft, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> said. Two or
three months later, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SabreTech</ENAMEX> official ordered them returned to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>. Consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s statement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> lead
investigator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory Feith</ENAMEX> said the boxes were marked as company
material, the shipping manifest said the canisters were ``empty.''
<p>
   About 119 oxygen canisters were in the cargo hold, more than
double the amount originally thought, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feith</ENAMEX> said. No plastic safety
caps were used to cover the firing mechanisms on the canisters, he
said. ``We're cooperating fully with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and
Department'' to find out why the box was mislabeled, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reddick</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabreliner</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>-based company that specializes in engine
overhaul and structural modification of government and civilian
aircraft, purchased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SabreTech</ENAMEX>, formerly known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DynAire</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last
year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reddick</ENAMEX> said. He said this is the first time an incident like
this has happened at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SabreTech</ENAMEX>. ``We are very proud of our very
good safety record, and we're doing everything possible to check to
see that the proper procedures are followed,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reddick</ENAMEX> said. On
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Jordan</ENAMEX> ask Americans to wait for
the results of the federal probe before abandoning the troubled
airline.
<p>
   ``We think it would be a tragedy for the American people who
can't afford high fares to not have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> around,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC

from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 10</TIMEX>, the day before Flight 592 crashed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida
Everglades</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The maintenance company's admission won't completely repair
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s reputation with travelers, investors and analysts said.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s got to convince the public that its 27-year-old
planes are OK to fly,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Cabell</ENAMEX>, co-manager of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAA
Aggressive Growth Fund</ENAMEX>, which owns 150,000 shares of the airline's
stock. ``There's still a nagging credibility problem.''
<p>
   Attorneys also said the admission by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SabreTech</ENAMEX>, the
aircraft maintenance firm, doesn't eliminate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s legal
liability in the crash.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> bonds traded as high as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">85 cents</NUMEX> on the dollar <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>,
little changed from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s close of 85.25.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> also acknowledged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> that co-founder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Flynn</ENAMEX>
sold <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 percent</NUMEX> of his stake in the airline <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine days after the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> crash</TIMEX> to satisfy a margin call.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SabreTech</ENAMEX>, a unit of closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabreliner Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>,
said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that five boxes containing 119 oxygen generators
were delivered to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> without federally required
labels identifying them as hazardous.
<p>
   Investigators found evidence that an explosion of one or more of
the canisters in the plane's cargo hold may have triggered the
crash.
<p>
   Showing that the canisters were mislabeled isn't enough to
convince consumers that the airline is safe, analysts said.
<p>
   ``That's just one issue out of many that has been raised about
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> since the crash,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vivian Lee</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BT
Securities</ENAMEX>. ``Until there are more definitive answers, it's too
soon to guess about the company's future.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> has spent most of the year under intense regulatory
scrutiny after the airline had five minor accidents, including a
fire in one plane. Its planes had 11 serious mechanical problems
that disrupted flights in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last two years</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Also, it has been widely reported since the crash that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>
has the oldest fleet of any <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> airline. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avitas Inc.</ENAMEX>, a consulting
firm, says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s planes average 26.4 years old. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kiwi
International Airlines</ENAMEX> has the second-oldest fleet with jets
averaging 22.8 years.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> DC-9 that crashed was 27 years old.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s liability in connection with the crash is likely to be
diminished, but not eliminated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SabreTech</ENAMEX>'s admission, attorneys
said.
<p>
   ``This won't get <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> off the hook, but it may give them a
co-defendant,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Kreindler</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kreindler &AMP; Kreindler</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New
York</ENAMEX>, whose firm represents plaintiffs in airline crash cases.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> was obligated to open the crate of oxygen canisters and
inspect at least some to determine whether they were empty, said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Wimsatt</ENAMEX>, a partner at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magana, Cathcart &AMP;
McCarthy</ENAMEX>, a law firm specializing in aviation law.
<p>
   ``It certainly could be expected that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> wouldn't rely on
what someone told them about a potentially hazardous product that
would be put on their airplane,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wimsatt</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$750 million</NUMEX> liability insurance to cover the crash.
<p>
   Oxygen generators, if full, are considered hazardous materials
and aren't supposed to be shipped aboard commercial flights, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> has said.
<p>
   ``We acknowledge that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SabreTech</ENAMEX> delivered to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> boxes
containing the canisters with a shipping ticket marked as
`empty','' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Reddick</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for the maintenance company's
parent. ``We're certainly concerned about this.''
<p>
   Still, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SabreTech</ENAMEX> said it doesn't accept responsibility for the
crash.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> made an independent decision to ship their company
materials on board an aircraft, and apparently did not ensure that
they were properly labeled, packaged and stored,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth P.
Quinn</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SabreTech</ENAMEX> spokesman.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard &AMP; Poor's</ENAMEX> said it's considering lowering the rating of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SabreLiner</ENAMEX>'s bonds.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> co-founder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Flynn</ENAMEX> sold <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 percent</NUMEX> of his stake in
the airline <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine days after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> crash</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flynn</ENAMEX>, one of four founders of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-based airline and a
board member, sold 1.5 million shares <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>, raising <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$16.9
million</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flynn</ENAMEX> still owns 4.5 million shares.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flynn</ENAMEX> sold the shares to satisfy a margin call, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregg
Kenyon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> spokesman. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenyon</ENAMEX> declined to say how much margin
debt was owed.
<p>
   A margin call is a broker's demand for additional cash or
securities so that an investor can continue to borrow from the
broker to buy securities.
<p>
   The shares <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flynn</ENAMEX> sold -- worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$52 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> --would
have been worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$19.5 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, with the stock's rebound.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s stock isn't likely rebound to the upper teens, where
it traded before the crash, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Lewins</ENAMEX> an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gruntal &AMP;
Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   ``Probably because of all the publicity, it will take them a
year to grow out of this,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewins</ENAMEX> said.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark McDonald</ENAMEX> has weathered almost every storm imaginable since
he started <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nations Air</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>. The small airline, which has
served <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>, was shut down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">for a
week</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last July</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> for a
paperwork violation. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few months earlier</TIMEX>, a bank pulled its
commitment at the last minute to lend him <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 million</NUMEX>. A company
that leased him a plane took it back in the middle of the night
because of a mix-up.
<p>
   But his airline could not withstand the impact of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet
Airlines</ENAMEX> crash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 days ago</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nations Air</ENAMEX> is halting scheduled service and laying off a third
of its staff to go into the charter business, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonald</ENAMEX> said. He was
forced to make the decision after he saw reservations drop, and
drop some more, after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> crash because of travelers'
concerns about fledgling airlines like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nations Air</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   When a plane crashes, the airline that operates it usually sees
cancellations and a drop in bookings for anywhere from a week to a
few months. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> crash on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11</TIMEX> has raised concerns
among travelers who have been flying increasingly on smaller and
younger airlines, with names that are less well known than
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nations Air</ENAMEX> may be an extreme example, but some other low-fare,
smaller airlines said that bookings had dropped since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>
crash, and many more said they were fielding questions from scores
of anxious travelers about the safety of their aircraft.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jet Train</ENAMEX>, an airline that started serving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newark</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>, said that although it has had few
cancellations, the number of its daily bookings dropped by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30
percent</NUMEX> in the days immediately after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> crash. It has
also received hundreds of calls from travelers asking questions
about the age of its fleet.
<p>
   ``Certainly we have been impacted,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Davis</ENAMEX>, the
airline's president. ``But it appears to be returning to near
normal levels.''
<p>
   Other airlines like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tower Air</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reno Air</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kiwi Airlines</ENAMEX> said
that they had also received calls from passengers with questions
about their safety records and fleet age, but that they had seen
few cancellations. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kiwi</ENAMEX>, whose route network overlaps many
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> routes, has seen bookings rise by about <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX> since the
crash.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest Airlines</ENAMEX>, another low-fare airline, said it had seen
no drop in bookings, and only sporadic safety-related questions
from its customers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> is also better known than many
start-ups; it is the eighth-largest airline in the country, has
been in business <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 years</TIMEX> and has never had a crash.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonald</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nations Air</ENAMEX>, said he felt blindsided. The day after
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> crash, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonald</ENAMEX> said his bookings dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 percent</NUMEX>.
On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, they dropped another <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 percent</NUMEX>. As the week wore on,
they remained at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX> below earlier levels.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nations Air</ENAMEX>, which has never had an incident or accident, was
suddenly losing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100,000</NUMEX> a week with no certainty of when business
would bounce back. The airline had been hovering around break even.
It laid off 46 employees on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``We are not large enough to stand by and burn off that type of
money,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonald</ENAMEX>, who decided to start flying charter service
because it is a more reliable source of income, though it has less
potential for profits and rapid growth.
<p>
   ``There's been an erosion of consumer confidence in the industry
and you don't know how long it's going to last,'' he said.
<p>
   Until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> crash, the public confidence in such airlines
appeared to have been high. Airlines were being started at a rate
not seen since immediately after the industry was deregulated in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, about 50 applications have been filed to start
new airlines, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> said. It is a trend the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> has applauded, stating recently that such
low-cost airlines saved consumers <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6.3 billion</NUMEX> a year. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> has
said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> crash was the first for a jet airline that
started after deregulation.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> has set the pace for the growth of such airlines,
expanding to 320 flights since it started in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1993</TIMEX>. It said
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Friday</TIMEX> that it would cut its schedule in half.
<p>
   Officials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>, which has been highly profitable, are
expected to talk on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> with Wall Street analysts who follow
the airline industry about the effects of the crash on its
finances.
<p>
   The airline, an unusually strong performer in an industry where
profits have long been thin or nonexistent, has been as popular
with investors as it was with travelers, with its stock rising
quickly in anticipation of profitable growth.
<p>
   When the stock market opened on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> after the crash,
shares in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> that had been trading at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$17.875</NUMEX> immediately lost
a third of their value. They have since rebounded somewhat, closing
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$13.125</NUMEX>, up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.875</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>'s close.
<p>
   However, one investor who recently sold shares in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> was
also a founder of the airline. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Flynn</ENAMEX>, one of four founders,
sold 1.5 million hares on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>. But the airline said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flynn</ENAMEX>
sold the stock to pay off money that he borrowed for investment
purposes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flynn</ENAMEX> still owned 4.5 million shares of
the airline.

COUPLE RECALLS JET'S FLAWS BEFORE CRASH

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ATLANTA</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Just hours before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> Flight 592 crashed into the
swampy muck, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pamela Hettinger</ENAMEX> was sitting on the same DC-9, looking
out her window high above the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX> and imagining a similar
fate, because she thought the plane was in trouble.
<p>
   She and her husband, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wayne Hettinger</ENAMEX>, were aboard the
27-year-old jet's next-to-last flight.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11</TIMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning of the crash</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hettingers</ENAMEX> boarded
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> Flight 591 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>. After a quiet
flight, the plane began its descent. Suddenly, she said, the cabin
lights went dark and the public address system failed. ``They had
to use a bullhorn to tell people to put their seatbelts back on,''
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hettinger</ENAMEX> said. She remembers looking outside then with
visions of a plunge to her death.
<p>
   Within 10 minutes, Flight 591 had landed safely in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>. But
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hettinger</ENAMEX>, who flies four or five times a year and had flown
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> before without concern, said that she had tried to persuade
her husband to leave the plane with her even before they left
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   She became concerned, she said, after the airplane returned to
the gate twice before taking off. ``I know accidents happen, but I
just feel like that plane should have never left the ground,'' she
said in an interview on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hettinger</ENAMEX> echoed her account in a
separate interview.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hettingers</ENAMEX>' recollections provide the first detailed public
description of the mechanical difficulties aboard the aircraft
hours before it crashed. While federal investigators are focusing
on the possibility that oxygen generators in the cargo hold caused
the crash, they have not ruled out other sources of the fire on
board, including wiring. Shortly after the crash, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal
Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> rule took effect requiring airlines that
fly DC-9's to check them for chafed wires in the cockpit.
<p>
   Other passengers on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hettingers</ENAMEX>' flight could not be reached
for comment, and safety officials had few details about Flight 591.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> spokesman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregg Kenyon</ENAMEX>, also refused to discuss the
flight, saying, ``We are not able to talk about anything that
happened with aircraft 904'' after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 9</TIMEX>.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory Feith</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>'s
lead investigator for the crash that killed 110 people, gave a
brief account of Flight 591 at a press conference in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> several
days after the crash.
<p>
   Before the jet took off from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> ``there was a problem with
the circuit breakers'' for the fuel pumps, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feith</ENAMEX> said, adding: ``A
mechanic came on, thought that he had fixed it, and got off. The
problem had not been resolved and he got back on. The problem was
resolved and the aircraft departed.''
<p>
   Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hettinger</ENAMEX> recalled watching those events from her seat in
the second row of the aircraft in front of its left wing. After the
jet pulled back from its gate, she said, its lights went out, the
public address system stopped working and, moments later, the
engines clicked off. The plane restarted and returned to the gate,
she said.
<p>
   A mechanic boarded and went into the cockpit, then the cabin,
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hettinger</ENAMEX> said. After he left, the plane again backed away
from the gate, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hettinger</ENAMEX> recalled.
<p>
   Again, the cabin lights went dark and the public address system
failed. Flight 591 returned to its gate, and the mechanic
reappeared, stayed 15 minutes and left.
<p>
   ``The third time, we took off,'' Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hettinger</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hettingers</ENAMEX> learned after boarding a cruise ship in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>
that the plane they had flown had crashed.
<p>
   ``That is when it made me a little weak-kneed,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hettinger</ENAMEX> said,
``because for the life of me I can't see why they ever left again,
with all that going on.''

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VALUJET</ENAMEX> TAPE HOLDS WARNING OF FIRE TO THE PILOT
(HLW)
By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MICHAEL WINES</ENAMEX>
c.<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.Y. Times News Service</ENAMEX>

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The pilots of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> Flight 592 were some six
minutes into a routine flight out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> when someone apparently
burst through the cockpit door to warn of a fire in the passenger
cabin, according to investigators' first analysis of the tape from
the jet's battered cockpit voice recorder.
<p>
   ``There was also an indication from the cabin that there were
problems obtaining oxygen,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Francis</ENAMEX>, the vice-chairman of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>, said at a briefing on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Beyond that, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said, the first review of the recorder
disclosed little about the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11</TIMEX> crash, which killed all 110 crew
members and passengers aboard the DC-9.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> refused to speculate on the meanings of any of the
cockpit exchanges or to say whether the shortage of oxygen referred
to breathable air in the cabin or the functioning of the oxygen
masks that are supposed to drop automatically from above
passengers' seats in emergencies.
<p>
   He said that he had not personally listened to the recording but
that he had been told that it was extraordinarily difficult to
decipher and yielded little else on its first playing.
<p>
   ``At this stage, we have not had the opportunity to do enough
work on the tape to say how much help it's going to be,'' he said.
``This is not going to be a matter of hours, but of days.'' The
recorder was pulled out of the muck of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida Everglades</ENAMEX> crash
site and flown to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   At the briefing, the safety board displayed the thick aluminum
recorder case, roughly the size of a hard-cover book, that held the
flight recorder in the jet's tail section. In the center of the
case was a deep puncture, evidence of an immense collision between
the recorder and something else as the plane hit the ground and
disintegrated.
<p>
   The penetration of the recorder case, which is meant to
withstand the worst of crashes, underscored the speed at which the
jet plummeted when it fell 7,500 feet into the swamp.
<p>
   ``It required an enormous amount of force, whatever went into
it,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said. ``We were extremely fortunate that we came out
with an intact piece of tape.''
<p>
   The tape did appear to confirm that crew members first found
evidence of a fire in the passenger cabin and not the cockpit.
Searchers said on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> that they had found a passenger seat frame
with melted aluminum that pointed to a cabin-area fire.
<p>
   But federal investigators have said they suspect the fire began
in the jet's forward cargo hold, directly below the cabin. A
principal theory is that one or more oxygen generators the jet
carried in its forward cargo hold accidentally activated.
<p>
   That would have produced intense heat and could have started an
explosion in any of several aircraft tires that were also stored in
the hold.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> stressed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, however, that experts had not yet
settled on a specific explanation and that they would continue to
search for clues at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX> crash site.
<p>
   In particular, he said the searchers would look for any parts
that helped control the plane's flight and for a set of circuit
breakers controlling the fuel pumps, which mechanics had worked on
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, the plane's last stop before it flew to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The disclosure that someone had to alert the pilots to the fire
also raises the question, perhaps never to be answered, of whether
the crash might have been averted had the DC-9 been equipped with
smoke detectors in its cargo hold.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> had recommended before
the accident that cargo areas in passenger aircraft be outfitted
with fire-detection systems. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation
Administration</ENAMEX>, which regulates the industry, has not acted on the
safety board's advice.
<p>
   Despite the damage to the flight recorder, safety officials were
hopeful of finding more clues to the crash. The tape ``had
obviously been subjected to impact and showed signs of that,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Loeb</ENAMEX>, the director of the board's office of aviation
safety, said after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>'s briefing. It also had soaked in the
brackish water of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">for two weeks</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Even so, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loeb</ENAMEX> added, ``The tape was in generally good
condition.'' The greatest challenge facing the engineers who are
trying to pick scraps of conversation from the tape is not its
condition, he said, but the background noise from the jet's
cockpit.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loeb</ENAMEX> said such noise is common on tapes from cockpit recorders,
and varies according to the microphones in use in the cockpit at
the time. He said he was optimistic that much of the noise could be
removed by electronic filters and other means.
<p>
   The tape is intended to record continuously, saving the
most-recent 30 minutes of data, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said a full half-hour
of conversation appeared to be on the recording.
<p>
   He also said there were ``some indications'' of gaps in the
recording similar to large gaps that punctuated the tape of the
jet's flight data recorder, which stores basic information about
the how the aircraft was piloted.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julie Beal</ENAMEX>, the safety board's spokesman, said the cockpit
recorder had been flown to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> in a cooler
filled with swamp water to maintain the tape in the state in which
it had been found.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MILLERSBURG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Flight Officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Gallion</ENAMEX> was buried here
near his home in Amish country on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Memorial Day</TIMEX>, more than
52 years after his P-47 Thunderbolt fighter plane was downed by
German machine gun fire and crashed into the waters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zuider
Zee</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The 29-year-old pilot was reported missing on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 3, 1943</TIMEX>, his
body never found. Then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> the propeller of a Dutch dredging
ship hit something, and when a diver went down to investigate,
there, in 10 feet of water, was the skeleton of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gallion</ENAMEX>, almost
intact, seated in the cockpit of his plane.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, at precisely <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 p.m.</TIMEX> in a pouring rain, an honor guard
from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Knox</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ky.</ENAMEX>, placed a container smaller than a shoe box
holding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gallion</ENAMEX>'s ashes in the back of a long silver hearse. Then a
procession of 20 cars snaked past the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Holmes County</ENAMEX> Courthouse and
war memorial, which look exactly as they did when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Gallion</ENAMEX> and
his brother, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ottmar</ENAMEX>, were boys swimming in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saps Run Creek</ENAMEX>, and on
past places that those country boys could never have imagined, like
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pizza Hut</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">State Road 83</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   As the procession climbed the last hill before <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pleasant Grove
Cemetery</ENAMEX>, Maj. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Deckard</ENAMEX>, the casualty officer who had
organized the ceremony, worried that there would be ``more press
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> than mourners.'' But then his car reached the hill's
crest, and there, parked along the road to the cemetery, were cars
and pickups, Suburbans and minivans as far as the eye could see,
and the major was reminded of the strong pull that World War II
still holds for Americans.
<p>
   Of the more than 16 million Americans who served in the military
in World War II, the remains of about 78,700 have never been
recovered. Each year 10 to 20, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gallion</ENAMEX>, are found by farmers
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netherlands</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Pacific</ENAMEX>, by workers for
water authorities or highway departments.
<p>
   ``Sometimes they'll recover a B-17 or B-29 and we'll get back 8
or 9 in one aircraft,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Campbell</ENAMEX>, the chief of
disposition for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> casualty and memorial affairs operations.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gallion</ENAMEX>, a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">334th Fighter Squadron</ENAMEX>, had taken off
from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX> that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> day in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943</TIMEX> to escort American B-17
bombers, part of a 500-plane attack force that passed over the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netherlands</ENAMEX> on its way to a military base in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wilhelmshaven</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two weeks later</TIMEX> his wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phyllis</ENAMEX>, received a 17-word cable
saying that he was missing in action. Notice that he was mia
appeared in the Holmes County Farmer-Hub. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1945</TIMEX>, his
mother placed a headstone for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gallion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pleasant Grove Cemetery</ENAMEX>,
but his only surviving brother, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ottmar</ENAMEX>, now 78, said on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> that
for years he had wondered whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX> had been taken prisoner by
the Germans and died in a camp.
<p>
   As the decades passed, family members would periodically make
inquiries to Dutch and American officials, with no luck. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phyllis Gallion</ENAMEX> died. She had never remarried, nor had she had
children, but had worked much of her life as a hairdresser. Until
her mother-in-law's death in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1960s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phyllis</ENAMEX> would visit
her once a year. After that, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gallion</ENAMEX> family lost track of her.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1995</TIMEX>, came word of the Dutch dredging company's find
about a quarter of a mile into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zuider Zee</ENAMEX>, 50 miles north of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Gallion</ENAMEX>, a 43-year-old nephew, said the Dutch were
able to identify the uncle by his dog tags and a serial number on
the plane. After a ceremony in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netherlands</ENAMEX> attended by family
members, the remains were flown to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX>'s central
identification laboratory in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Several weeks ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deckard</ENAMEX>, the casualty officer, drove the
``artifacts'' recovered from the plane to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Gallion</ENAMEX>'s home in
this village of 3,200. ``It's not pretty stuff,'' the major told
the nephew and other family members as he spread the muddy items on
top of the kitchen table. ``But it is the facts of your uncle.''
<p>
   There were scraps of fabric, buttons, a rusted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zippo</ENAMEX> lighter, a
brass compass, a fishing lure that may have been part of a survival
kit, a pant cuff and two boot soles marked size 10-E. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX> had
thick ankles,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ottmar Gallion</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, before the funeral, people asked what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX> had been
like, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ottmar</ENAMEX>, who had earned a living as a laborer and
salesman, seemed to have trouble remembering so far back. Mainly he
spoke of their hiking trips, their swimming together in the creek
and their competitiveness. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ottmar Gallion</ENAMEX> had spent the war
guarding German prisoners in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> and he was asked, if perhaps,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX>, who had gone to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1941</TIMEX> to join up early, had been
the more adventurous brother.
<p>
   ``Oh, I wouldn't say so,'' he replied. ``I was the only one
around here who would dive off the bridge into the river.''
<p>
   At the graveside service on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> in the pouring rain there
were women and children, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX> veterans like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Buehler</ENAMEX>, World
War II veterans like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Emerick</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Anielski</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert
Spahr</ENAMEX>, a villager, who grew up next door to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gallions</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gallion</ENAMEX>'s only surviving sister, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clela Joy Davis</ENAMEX> 88, who lives
nearby in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Walnut Creek</ENAMEX> nursing home.
<p>
   Family members sat in three rows under a tent facing the box of
ashes atop a table.
<p>
   There were several speakers, including an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> chaplain, the
minister from the family's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seventh Day Adventist Church</ENAMEX> and Rep.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Regula</ENAMEX>, the area's Congressman. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ottmar Gallion</ENAMEX> spoke for the
family. He said there was relief and closure in finding how his
brother died.
<p>
   ``It was a clean kill, he was out of his misery and from then on
the thing was in God's hands,'' he said.
<p>
   Many times in recent weeks, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ottmar Gallion</ENAMEX> had said he wasn't
saddened; it was all so long ago. But by the conclusion of his
speech on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, his voice was barely audible, and when he sat
down, he blew his nose.
<p>
   At the end there was a 21-gun salute, a bugler blowing taps and
then First Lt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William J. Duggan III</ENAMEX> presented <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ottmar Gallion</ENAMEX> with
an American flag.
<p>
   Afterwards, the whole village was invited to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Legion
Post 192</ENAMEX> in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Millersburg</ENAMEX>. ``They're going to have a nice
little spread,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deckard</ENAMEX> said.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  She's been an organized-crime prosecutor in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas
City</ENAMEX>, and she's worked in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> White House</ENAMEX>. She's had a top
post in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Department</ENAMEX> and been featured as one of ``10
outstanding young working women'' in Glamour magazine.
<p>
   She can even fly a plane and throw her voice.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Fackler Schiavo</ENAMEX> has skipped from one high-profile job to
another like a stone dancing across a pond.
<p>
   Except now she has made a ripple, and a big one at that.
<p>
   When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> Flight 592 crashed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida Everglades</ENAMEX> on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11</TIMEX>, the issue of Newsweek on the stands <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="Saturday">that Saturday</TIMEX> carried a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX> column about airline safety.
<p>
   ``I go out of my way to stay off commuter planes,'' she wrote.
``... I would not fly on marginal airlines (and because of its many
mishaps, I also avoided flying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>.)''
<p>
   But this was more than just a personal essay from a trained
pilot and frequent flier.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX>, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Sterling</ENAMEX> when she lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX>,
is the inspector general for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Transportation</ENAMEX>. In
her words, she is ``helping to police the country's skies.''
<p>
   More succinctly, she's been one of the most outspoken
bureaucrats about aircraft safety, inspections and the problem of
faulty parts installed in planes.
<p>
   Her role as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cassandra</ENAMEX> of the airways has put her on opposite
sides of others in federal airline regulation. But if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX> was a
flash point for criticism before her column and the crash, she's
now at the center of the controversy.
<p>
   Her superiors at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX>, where the party
line is always that the government has complete confidence in the
airline industry, blanched at her comments.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hinson</ENAMEX>, head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX>, said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX> was ``entitled to her opinion.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation</ENAMEX> Secretary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Federico Pena</ENAMEX> has assured the public that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> is safe.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX>'s critics in the industry say that, while she is smart
and aggressive, she is a media hound who has unnecessarily
frightened the traveling public.
<p>
   ``I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> needs to increase and enhance its training and
pay attention to things like unapproved parts and other issues she
has brought to the forefront,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah MacLeod</ENAMEX>, a lawyer and
executive director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeronautical Repair Station Association</ENAMEX>,
which represents companies that repair airline parts. ``I agree
with her on a lot of her points. I don't agree with how she is
going about her job and overstepping her boundaries, and I don't
agree with her grabbing headlines.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX> could not be reached for comment. She has kept quiet
since the days immediately following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> crash, when she
was on national television saying that the low-budget carrier's
record was under review.
<p>
   The 40-year-old prosecutor-turned-political appointee became the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX>'s inspector general in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> after a swift
rise in government and political circles.
<p>
   She grew up on a farm and attended school in a small town
outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toledo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, where she was twirling champion. She also
taught herself ventriloquism as a hobby, was flying by the age of
10 and became a certified pilot at 18. She earned degrees from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio
State</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York University</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX> joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney's office in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>
at age 27. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Missouri Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert G. Ulrich</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney at the time, remembers that her letter of application
and resume stood out among the nearly 400 he received during his
eight years as prosecutor.
<p>
   ``It was impressive,'' he said. ``... I suspect the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>
approaches things, she recognizes and determines a goal; then she
goes and gets it.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX> worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ulrich</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">for three years</TIMEX> and then joined the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organized Crime Strike Force</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">for a year</TIMEX>. At time she was
married to lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Sterling</ENAMEX>, the chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson County
Republican Party</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   She left <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX> to become a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">White House</ENAMEX> fellow and a
special assistant to then-Attorney General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwin Meese</ENAMEX>. She
returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> to run President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s presidential
campaign in the state.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX> aggressively sought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ulrich</ENAMEX>'s post when he left, but she
didn't make the final cut of three candidates. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney
job eventually went to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Paul Bradshaw II</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   She worked for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDowell, Rice &AMP; Smith</ENAMEX> law firm for a while
but returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> to work for then-Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Dole</ENAMEX> as an assistant secretary for labor-management
standards.
<p>
   As inspector general at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation</ENAMEX>, she has been credited by
many for pushing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> to get tough on the problems of faulty
parts and for beefing up the criminal dimension of her office.
<p>
   Aviation Week &AMP; Space Technology magazine praised her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>
for winning more than 100 convictions in her investigations. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last
week</TIMEX> the journal complimented her work on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> but also fired a
dart.
<p>
   ``She should stick to what she does best,'' the magazine
editorialized, ``finding problems, not creating them.''
<p>
   She also took criticism after she butted heads with a top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>
official, accusing him of blocking one of her investigations. He
was cleared by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>, but the episode painted her
in some quarters as someone who acted outside proper channels and
was magnetized by the glare of publicity.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> has shown no indications that it plans
to take any action against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX>, who was appointed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>
administration. Among some on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION|LOCATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX>, however, the mood is
that of a hunter who suddenly finds prey in his sights.
<p>
   Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Stevens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>, the Republican chairman of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Governmental Affairs Committee</ENAMEX>, which has oversight over the
inspector generals, was furious at her comments about the safety of
commuter planes.
<p>
   ``That's easily <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> of the traffic in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitch Rose</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> aide. ``(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX>) has never been approached
by her or been given that impression. He thought her statements
were over-broad.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX>' committee plans to review two years' worth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX>'s
audits and investigative reports to see whether they bear out her
Newsweek comments.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MacLeod</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX> and everyone involved in the debate over
airline safety needed a dose of reality.
<p>
   ``We have the safest airline system in the world,'' she said,
``but life comes with no guarantees.''

DC-9 COCKPIT TAPE CONTAINS NOISE SUPPORTING BLAST THEORY

<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The cockpit voice recorder of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet Airlines</ENAMEX>
DC-9 that crashed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11</TIMEX> recorded ``a brief
unidentified sound'' less than six minutes after takeoff, and
almost immediately, the captain ``stated the need to go back to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> investigators said on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The investigators' brief statement does not say what the sound
was, and, in fact, refers to it four times on a single page as
``unidentified.'' But a chronology in the statement seems to show
that the crew acted properly in response to the noise.
<p>
   The crash killed all 110 people on board, and investigators
found parts of oxygen generators embedded in a fire-damaged tire.
Aviation experts said on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> that a possible source of
the sound would be the pop of a spare aircraft tire if it had been
heated by a fire in the forward cargo hold. The board has already
said that the plane was carrying oxygen generators, which can start
fires, and that some of these had been stacked on top of an
inflated tire.
<p>
   The flight data recorder, which has already been analyzed, gives
evidence that there might have been an explosion on board. The
statement released on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, describing a preliminary analysis
of the voice recorder, did not state unequivocally that the sound
was related to the crash but gives a partial chronology keyed
around that event: The sound occurred about 5 minutes and 47
seconds after takeoff; the captain ``questioned'' the sound; 17
seconds after hearing it, she said the plane, which was still
climbing on its way to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Atlanta</TIMEX>, must return to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Miami</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Five seconds later, ``voices were heard from the passenger cabin
reporting fire.'' Eleven seconds after that, the co-pilot radioed
for clearance to return. The crash occurred about seven minutes
later.
<p>
   The sequence, as described by the investigators, indicates that
the crew took prompt action to try to land, which aviation experts
say is the most important step pilots can take in the event of a
fire. An unresolved question is whether the plane could have landed
closer than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Miami</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The statement also said ``the aircraft and systems appear normal
before the unidentified sound.'' Afterwards, the statement said,
there were two apparent interruptions of power to the cockpit voice
recorder. The first began 1 minute and 39 seconds after the sound
and lasted 1 minute and 17 seconds; the second was just before the
end of the tape.
<p>
   Aviation experts say the reason could be fire damage to the
plane's electrical system, or could be the crew, believing that the
problem was an electrical fire, turning off various electrical
systems. Electrical problems have not been ruled out.

<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NOV. 3, 1973</TIMEX>  &MD; 
<p>
   Heavy smoke and fumes cause a crash that kills three crewmen and
destroys a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 707. An improperly packaged container of
nitric acid burst into flames in the cargo compartment. The Clipper
160 cargo plane bound from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">John F. Kennedy Airport</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, crashed during an emergency landing at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan Airport</ENAMEX>. After the crash, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Line Pilots Association</ENAMEX>
formally recommended to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safety Board</ENAMEX> that ``all hazardous
materials be banned from interstate air transportation.''
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AUG. 19, 1980</TIMEX>  &MD; 
<p>
   A cargo compartment fire spreads through a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudi Arabian
Airlines</ENAMEX> L-1011, killing all 301 people aboard. The pilot was able
to successfully land the jet in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Riyadh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>. But
evacuation attempts failed. Although unable to determine the cause
of the fire, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> used the
incident to push for better methods for containing fires in cargo
holds. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> recommended installation of fiberglass ceiling
liners in lieu of the standard C-2 Nomex fabric liners used in
cargo compartments at the time.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AUG. 10, 1986</TIMEX>  &MD; 
<p>
   Fire consumes an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Trans Air</ENAMEX> DC-10 after passenger and
crew deplane in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>. A jostled oxygen generating canister  &MD; 
similar to the ones carried aboard <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> Flight 592  &MD;  set off the
fire in the cargo hold.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">FEB. 3, 1988</TIMEX>  &MD; 
<p>
   An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> DC-9 makes an emergency landing in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX>, forcing 126 passengers and crew to evacuate after
chemicals illegally shipped from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX> start a fire in the cargo
hold. The floor in the passenger cabin melted and smoke wafted
through the cabin. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> called
for fire detection and extinguishing equipment in Class D cargo
holds. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> rejected the recommendation because it would cost
more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$350 million</NUMEX> to retrofit existing aircraft.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">FEB. 1, 1991</TIMEX>  &MD; 
<p>
   Fire breaks out in the cargo hold of a DC-9 bound from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charlotte</ENAMEX>
to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greensboro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX> No one is injured, but an illegal cache of tear
gas, volatile liquid dichloromethane, lamp oil, witch hazel and

<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AUG. 20, 1993</TIMEX>  &MD; 
<p>
   A leaking package containing blood tainted with the HIV virus
was packed as air freight in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santa Rosa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX> Several cargo
loaders handled the unmarked package before someone placed it in a
clear plastic bag. An inspection revealed the package contained
human tissue and blood samples, which laboratory tests revealed
were positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> FACES PROBLEMS IN MONITORING AIRLINE MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS
(af)
By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ADAM BRYANT</ENAMEX>
c. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.Y. Times News Service</ENAMEX>
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   With the nation's airlines farming out an increasing amount of
maintenance work, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> is struggling
to monitor an intricate web of contractors that stretches around
the world.
<p>
   Before deregulation of the industry in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>, airlines did most
of their work themselves, making it relatively simple for
regulators to examine records and aircraft to insure that
procedures were being followed properly.
<p>
   But now that task is far more complicated than experts predicted
even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> airlines are trying to save
money by hiring companies domestically and overseas for major tasks
like overhauling engines, and they are farming out maintenance and
critical safety-related work like de-icing to various companies at
the many airports they serve.
<p>
   With this practice  &MD;  often called outsourcing  &MD;  the potential
for misunderstanding inevitably grows, aviation experts say,
particularly because few airlines operate exactly the same way.
<p>
   Federal officials believe that such a misunderstanding may have
led to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11</TIMEX> crash of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> DC-9 outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>
and its contractor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabretech</ENAMEX>, a maintenance company that does work
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>, are arguing over who was responsible for handling
oxygen-generating devices that investigators suspect caused the
crash, which killed 110 passengers and crew.
<p>
   The growing use of outsourcing by both start-up airlines like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> and major carriers is not inherently unsafe, experts say,
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> has responsibility for authorizing contractors in many
foreign countries.
<p>
   But such relationships do require more supervision. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>
has always assigned its front-line inspectors according to an
airline's size, not its use of subcontractors.
<p>
   ``The nature of the beast has changed,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel M. Kasper</ENAMEX>,
an aviation consultant and a member of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> presidential
commission that studied the airline industry.
<p>
   ``While flying remains the safest form of transportation, it
raises the question of whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> regulatory model has changed
sufficiently to oversee these virtual airlines.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> could be considered a prime example of a ``virtual
airline,'' relying heavily on contractors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabretech</ENAMEX> is one of six
companies that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> hired to do heavy maintenance, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>
has also contracted with more than a dozen other companies,
including airlines, to work on its planes at various airports.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s dispute with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabretech</ENAMEX> centers on the oxygen
generators, which are small chemical reactors that produce intense
heat when activated.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabretech</ENAMEX>, which is an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>-authorized maintenance company,
removed them from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> MD-80s because the generators' shelf life
had expired and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> officials said they told the contractor to
dispose of them.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabretech</ENAMEX> said it was given no such order and boxed up the
generators, mislabeled them ``Oxy Cannisters, Empty,'' and returned
them to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> then loaded the boxes into the cargo hold
of Flight 592.
<p>
   Internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> records show that on several occasions, inspectors
were concerned about a lack of oversight by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> of its
contractors. An inspector found, for instance, that maintenance was
not properly documented by one contractor and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> lacked
procedures to make sure it was done.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> also found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> did not make sure that companies
it hired  &MD;  including other airlines like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnival</ENAMEX>  &MD; 
were properly trained in its procedures. A company that trained
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> pilots did not send the airline records documenting poor
performance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> employees.
<p>
   After an engine broke up in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> DC-9 that was about to
take off from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last June</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> wrote to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>, telling
it to develop safeguards against acquiring ``questionable assets.''
<p>
   The plane was one of nine that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> bought from a Turkish
airline, which had worked on the faulty engine for a period when
its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> authorization had lapsed.
<p>
   As part of its closer scrutiny of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> after the crash, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> said it would conduct new inspections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s contractors.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> has suspended its contract with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabretech</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>
officials said they had improved their internal audit system for
working with contractors.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis H. Jordan</ENAMEX>, the airline's president, said the airline had
been ``very responsive'' in addressing each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s concerns.
<p>
   Other internal reports show that the agency was concerned that
its own oversight of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> was insufficient.
<p>
   Its inspection records ``clearly show some weakness in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s
surveillance,'' said an internal report released by the agency <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this
month</TIMEX>. In addition, the report recommended to top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> officials
that they consider a top-to-bottom check of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>, in part
because of the ``absence of adequate policies and procedures for
the maintenance personnel to follow.''
<p>
   A separate report described <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> as an ``unconventional
carrier,'' noting that it contracted out all its maintenance to
``geographically diverse low bidders.'' In an interview, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX>
said that cost was not <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s only consideration in choosing its
contractors.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David R. Hinson</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> administrator, said that the widespread
use of outsourcing in the industry is ``a relatively young
phenomenon'' and creates different challenges of oversight for the
agency, compared to when airlines were largely self-contained
organizations.

FATAL AIRLINE ATTACK DESCRIBED IN TERROR TRIAL
(bl)

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NEW YORK</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Prosecutors focused <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> on a deadly midair
explosion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramzi Yousef</ENAMEX> is accused of carrying out as a
rehearsal for a planned wave of attacks on a dozen American
jetliners, a continuation of a terror campaign that the indictment
says began with the World Trade Center bombing.
<p>
   The bomb exploded aboard <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philippines Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 434,
killing one passenger and injuring several others, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>
747 flew from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cebu</ENAMEX> in the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippines</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 11,
1994</TIMEX>. The pilot, who testified <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, managed to make an emergency
landing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Okinawa</ENAMEX> after the blast.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yousef</ENAMEX> is accused of planting the bomb himself on the first leg
of the flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manila</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cebu</ENAMEX> before quietly disembarking. He
and the other two defendants are accused of conspiring to replicate
that tactic in two days of terror they are said to have planned at
airports around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> to kill several thousand passengers.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yousef</ENAMEX>  &MD;  who has insisted upon conducting his own defense,
against the advice of the judge in the case  &MD;  sought to gain some
advantage from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>'s testimony, suggesting in his
cross-examination of the witnesses that the bomb had been planted
by someone else, even one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philippine Airlines</ENAMEX>' own maintenance
or cleaning workers.
<p>
   So far, the only witness to place <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yousef</ENAMEX> on the flight from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manila</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cebu</ENAMEX> has been a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philippine Airlines</ENAMEX> flight attendant,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria De La Cruz</ENAMEX>. She testified <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that she had seen him
briefly occupy the seat that later exploded. She served him a
beverage and snack before he got off in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cebu</ENAMEX>, she said.
<p>
   When the trial reconvened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, the prosecutors,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dietrich L. Snell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael J. Garcia</ENAMEX>, went on to present three
witnesses: the jetliner's Filipino captain, a Japanese passenger
who was injured in the explosion and a retired Okinawan police
officer who supervised the bombing investigation after the aircraft
landed at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Naha</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Okinawa</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Taking the stand, the aircraft's captain, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduardo Reyes</ENAMEX>,
testified that the sudden explosion had forced his plane, which had
nearly 300 passengers on board, to bank sharply to the right. ``It
was as if a big rocket exploded right in the room,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reyes</ENAMEX> said.
When he took the controls, he had to use force to make a wide turn.
``The plane responded, but very slowly,'' he said.
<p>
   The captain said he had landed the damaged jumbo jetliner at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Naha</ENAMEX> airport a half-hour later, after the control tower and another
small plane verified that his landing gear was down.
<p>
   When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yousef</ENAMEX> cross-examined <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reyes</ENAMEX>, he asked who else, including
mechanics and cleaners, had been given access to the plane's
interior while it was in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manila</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cebu</ENAMEX>. He also asked why the
flight had departed behind schedule.
<p>
   ``Do you know whether the late arrival of the stairs was
deliberate or not?'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yousef</ENAMEX> asked.
<p>
   ``No, sir,'' said the captain, who seemed puzzled by the
questioning. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yousef</ENAMEX> asked later whether passengers were required to
show passports before boarding. ``That is not my line, sir,'' the
pilot said. ``My job is to fly the aircraft.''
<p>
   The injured passenger, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yukihiko Ususi</ENAMEX>, said he had been sleeping
in the seat behind the passenger who was killed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haruki Ikegami</ENAMEX>.
When the blast occurred, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ususi</ENAMEX> said, he thought that the airliner
had crashed. Speaking through a Japanese interpreter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ususi</ENAMEX> said he
had tried to use the oxygen mask dangling above him, ``but then I
realized the oxygen mask was burned and was useless.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ikegami</ENAMEX> tried to ask for help and then collapsed, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ususi</ENAMEX>,
who then discovered that his own legs were ``burned and bloody.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ususi</ENAMEX> said he had looked at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ikegami</ENAMEX> ``and he looked dead.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ususi</ENAMEX> said he had been hospitalized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">for 16 days</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Okinawa</ENAMEX>, had
surgery twice and spent four more months in his local hospital in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. ``My legs occasionally still ache, and also I have a ringing
sensation in my ear,'' he said.
<p>
   In a brief cross-examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ususi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yousef</ENAMEX> asked whether he
was aware of blackmailing and other crimes committed against
Japanese businessmen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippines</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1994</TIMEX>. ``I
didn't know,'' replied <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ususi</ENAMEX>, looking baffled by the question.
<p>
   The defendant contends that he was being tortured in a Pakistani
prison at the time prosecutors accuse him of being in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippines</ENAMEX> and plotting to blow up 12 American jetliners with his
co-defendants, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdul Hakim Murad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wali Khan Amin Shah</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The prosecutors say they can prove that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yousef</ENAMEX> was in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippines</ENAMEX> at that time through <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yousef</ENAMEX>'s computer records and
fingerprints and other evidence.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yousef</ENAMEX> faces a subsequent trial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later this year</TIMEX> on charges of
masterminding the bombing of the World Trade Center in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February
1993</TIMEX>, an attack that killed six people and injured hundreds.

WHISTLEBLOWER SHIELD: AVIATION WORKERS WANT PROTECTION WHEN THEY
REPORT TROUBLE
By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MACON MOREHOUSE</ENAMEX>

<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ATLANTA</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Flight attendant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Chagares</ENAMEX> says when she heard
that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> plane, just deemed unairworthy by a pilot, had taken
off with a new crew and passengers, she didn't hesitate to report
it to her supervisors.
<p>
   For her effort, she says, she was forced to resign.
<p>
   ``If you raise questions about anything, by God, they are going
to get rid of you,'' she says.
<p>
   A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> spokesman said the airline investigated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chagares</ENAMEX>'
claims about the incident <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last New Year's Eve</TIMEX> and did not force her
out of her job.
<p>
   But stories like hers have prompted aviation employees to fight
for the same protection thousands of other workers have: the
freedom to fight back legally if they are punished for blowing the
whistle.
<p>
   A bill pending in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> would bar airlines and their
contractors from discriminating against an employee who reports
safety problems. Violations could be reported to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.
Department of Labor</ENAMEX> or, eventually, a federal court.
<p>
   Supporters say they hope <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>'s fatal crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>
Flight 592 helps speed passage of the law. A hearing before a
congressional subcommittee could be held as early as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 10</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``On any airline, if there are problems, it's the people working
on the planes who will see them,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jill Gallagher</ENAMEX>, spokeswoman
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association of Flight Attendants</ENAMEX>. ``Relying on the workers
would be a good thing.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Clyburn</ENAMEX> (D-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">S.C.</ENAMEX>), who introduced the bill, said
the fatal crash of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> flight in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charlotte</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</TIMEX>
prompted his concern.
<p>
   ``I take at least four flights a week,'' he said. ``For me to
sit there knowing a flight attendant is not on the team making sure
I am safe (because of a fear to report problems) is unbelievable.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>, both based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, say they do protect
employees who report problems and have telephone lines that
employees can call anonymously. Both say they encourage employees
to talk to their supervisors and do not discipline them for
reporting problems.
<p>
   ``It's an open-door policy,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregg
Kenyon</ENAMEX>. They also may report concerns to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation
Administration</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> prefers that they do not go to the news
media, spokeswoman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcia Scott</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> flight attendant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Wooten</ENAMEX> said on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>'s ``Nightline''
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> that ``flight attendants are afraid to say anything.''
When the reporter mentioned that she was still working for the
airline, she replied, ``Probably won't be after this interview.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wooten</ENAMEX> currently is on maternity leave, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chagares</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic Southeast Airlines</ENAMEX> flight attendant,
said her problems began a little more than three weeks after she
started working for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   She said she was working in the airline's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> operations
center <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 31</TIMEX> when a pilot came in and told the operations
supervisor that his plane needed several days worth of maintenance
and he would not fly it.
<p>
   The pilot was assigned to a different plane, she said, but 15
minutes later ``they boarded up the (first) plane with another crew
and they left,'' she said. She said someone asked if that was the
same plane that had maintenance problems and the supervisor
replied, ``It was the only one they had.''
<p>
   ``I don't know if what was wrong with the airplane was fixed,''
she said. ``If they can do two days' work in 15 minutes, they
really are a wonderful airline.''
<p>
   The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</TIMEX>, she told her supervisor and refused to fly again
until she got answers about what happened.
<p>
   ``We took her concerns very seriously,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenyon</ENAMEX> said.
He said the airline investigated but found no records of
maintenance problems in the log books. ``We took her concerns very
seriously,'' he said. ``We found no discrepancies and nothing wrong
with the aircraft.''
<p>
   He added that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chagares</ENAMEX> ``was offered various counseling and did
not come back.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chagares</ENAMEX> said she was told in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early February</TIMEX> to start flying or
they would assume she didn't want her job anymore.
<p>
   ``Nobody in that company will say anything, nobody,'' she said.
``That's why that whistleblower law is needed so badly.''
<p>
   While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX> said she was not familiar with the
whistleblower legislation, she said, ``Anything that provides the
airline and its people with a method of guaranteeing a higher level
of safety is great.'' .

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seven years ago this month</TIMEX>, 22-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deborah Ann
Rock</ENAMEX> died on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Austin</ENAMEX> when she was hit by the bow and propeller
of a boat that smashed into the idling boat in which she was
sitting.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rock</ENAMEX>'s parents won a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500,000</NUMEX> award from an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, jury
against the pilot of the moving boat, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Greenway</ENAMEX>. But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 1/2
years later</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rocks</ENAMEX> have yet to collect <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a penny</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenway</ENAMEX>,
thanks to the protection of federal bankruptcy law.
<p>
   That protection should not be available in future cases
involving boats and alcohol, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> decided <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>. By a voice
vote, members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> closed a loophole in bankruptcy law that
shielded drunk pilots of boats and airplanes from liability for
accidents that hurt or kill others.
<p>
   ``In the past, watercraft and aircraft operators have had little
fear of punishment knowing that this loophole existed,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vernon J. Ehlers</ENAMEX>, R-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>, the sponsor of the measure. ``With
this bill, the federal government will be doing its part to
supplement what the states . . . are doing to combat drunk boating
and flying.''
<p>
   Bankruptcy law currently allows debtors to cancel most of their
debts, with about a dozen exceptions. Those include federal taxes,
student loans and ``any debt for death or personal injury caused by
the debtor's operation of a motor vehicle'' while intoxicated by
alcohol or drugs.
<p>
   In at least three cases, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rocks</ENAMEX>' case against
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenway</ENAMEX>, courts have wrestled with the question of whether boats
are ``motor vehicles'' and whether drunk drivers of boats should be
shielded from liability.
<p>
   ``I'm just stunned that it's a hard question,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl O.
Bayer Jr.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX>, the lawyer for two other people who were in
the boat in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rock</ENAMEX> was killed. ``I didn't even figure it would
be a close call.''
<p>
   But two courts have agreed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenway</ENAMEX> and his lawyers that
the 21-foot Supra powerboat he was piloting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 30, 1989</TIMEX>, was not
a motor vehicle. Those rulings have kept <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenway</ENAMEX> from having to
pay the judgments won by the passengers and pilot of the other
boat.
<p>
   The legislation approved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> will not affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rocks</ENAMEX>' case
against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenway</ENAMEX>, but the case was one of three cited <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last November</TIMEX>
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX> when it reported on the need for
the legislation changing the bankruptcy law.
<p>
   The crash occurred on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Austin</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Loop 360</ENAMEX> bridge as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rock</ENAMEX>, two other passengers and the pilot sat on an idle 18-foot
Maxum powerboat. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenway</ENAMEX>'s boat hit the Maxum from behind and
became airborne, striking and killing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rock</ENAMEX> and severely injuring
another woman passenger.
<p>
   The wreck happened about an hour before <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>'
boating-while-intoxicated law took effect. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenway</ENAMEX>, whose
blood-alcohol level was between 0.09 and 0.11, was indicted on a
misdemeanor charge of criminally negligent homicide and pleaded no
contest to the charge in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1990</TIMEX>. He was sentenced to 30 days
in jail and fined <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,000</NUMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenway</ENAMEX>, now a lawyer in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX>, sought bankruptcy-court
protection shortly after a civil-court jury voted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1992</TIMEX>
to award <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500,000</NUMEX> in damages to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rock</ENAMEX>'s parents and a total of
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300,000</NUMEX> to three other people who were on the boat with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rock</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   A bankruptcy judge in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX> ruled that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenway</ENAMEX> could escape
liability for the judgments because a boat is not a motor vehicle
as described in bankruptcy law. That ruling was overturned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April
1995</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> District Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Nowlin</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX>, who wrote that
he could ``see no reason why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> would have been concerned
with drunk driving in one context and not the other.''
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier this year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nowlin</ENAMEX>'s ruling was reversed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals</ENAMEX>, which said a boat is not a motor vehicle.
The attorneys for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rock</ENAMEX>'s parents, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX> firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spivey,
Grigg, Kelly and Knisely</ENAMEX>, have asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX> to hear
the case.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenway</ENAMEX>, reached at his office, declined to comment.
<p>
   ``There's plenty I'd like to say,'' he said, ``but it's still in
court.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Adm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay L. Johnson</ENAMEX>, one of the fastest-rising
stars in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>, faces the most daunting challenge of his 28-year
career in taking command of a service wracked by tragedy and
turmoil.
<p>
   President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, calling this a ``crucial time'' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s
history, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> tapped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> to succeed his mentor, Adm.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeremy Boorda</ENAMEX>, who committed suicide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks ago</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Colleagues describe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>, who became 50 on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, as a
smart, decisive and low-key officer who as the new Chief of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naval
Operations</ENAMEX> would move quickly to reassure a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> badly shaken by
the death of his popular predecessor. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX> graduate of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Naval Academy</ENAMEX>, has been the vice chief of naval operations
since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay</ENAMEX> is a very steady, solid force who gives the impression of
being unflappable,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley R. Arthur</ENAMEX>, a retired admiral who
commanded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> forces in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> war. ``He'll present a
soothing image. You won't see a lot of flash and dash from him.''
<p>
   There is little doubt about the admiral's combat credentials. A
fighter pilot with 150 combat missions during the Vietnam War,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> won praise as head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Fleet</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
intervention in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Haiti</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, helping to coordinate the flying of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> helicopters off a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> aircraft carrier.
<p>
   A larger question is whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> can overcome a relative
lack of experience in the crucible of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> politicking and
in-fighting to turn around the military's most troubled service and
win over skeptics in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boorda</ENAMEX> did not attend the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> Tailhook convention, a
gathering of naval aviators in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> where 83 women were
assaulted, he was dogged by its legacy. Cheating and drugs at the
prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naval Academy</ENAMEX> and a series of crashes involving the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s fleet of aging F-14 fighter jets combined to create an image
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> spinning out of control.
<p>
   Now these are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s problems to resolve.
<p>
   ``He's got a very tough job ahead of him,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Pope</ENAMEX>,
who worked with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> when she was a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> personnel
official in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration.
<p>
   Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> officials expressed hope <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>,
a tall, striking figure and articulate speaker, would by his sheer
presence and leadership propel the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>, and its 422,000 men and
women, off the shoals of misfortune.
<p>
   But in contrast to the effervescent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boorda</ENAMEX>, who openly promoted
his common touch with sailors and his skill as a bureaucratic
infighter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> is more self-effacing and is not particularly
well known, even within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``He's not a big headline grabber,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur</ENAMEX>. ``But people
will expect an awful lot out of him. One thing he does need to do
is keep visible.''
<p>
   If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> confirms his nomination, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> would be one of
the youngest men to head the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX>. He would also
become the first aviator to assume the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s top-ranking job since
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The government's top regulator of the airline
industry said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that his agency should have done more to
monitor maintenance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet Airlines</ENAMEX>, which ceased operations
after a crash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> took 110 lives.
<p>
   ``We should have done a better job helping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> manage their
infrastructure, especially with respect to maintenance,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David
Hinson</ENAMEX>, chief of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX>, told
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX> said in testimony before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Transportation
Committee</ENAMEX> that the rapid growth of the low-cost, start-up airline
appeared to exceed its ability to perform proper maintenance on its
aircraft.
<p>
   ``<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A year ago in April</TIMEX> they had about 25 airplanes, and they grew
to 50 by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX> said. ``In that time frame, we might
have done a better of job of saying, `Why don't you slow down? Your
systems may not be quite capable of helping you manage your
growth.' There are some lessons learned there for us.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX> also told lawmakers that he would be leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> by
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">end of the year</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> that it was
accepting the retirement of the agency's assistant administrator,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Broderick</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> have come under intense
scrutiny since the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11</TIMEX> crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> Flight 592. Everyone
aboard was killed when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas</ENAMEX> DC-9 plunged nose
first into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida Everglades</ENAMEX> shortly after takeoff from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> halted operations at the request of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, which said
it found a series of maintenance problems during an intense
post-crash review of the carrier's operations.
<p>
   Industry and government experts complain that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> was lax in
overseeing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> and that the airline did not ensure that its
maintenance operations kept pace with the rapid expansion of its
fleet and routes.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Schiavo</ENAMEX>, inspector general for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation
Department</ENAMEX>, told lawmakers in the nine-hour hearing that she had
complained to the department about poor performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>
inspectors and potential problems in the fast-growing airline
industry.
<p>
   ``We believe that there is a culture of unaccountability at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX> said. ``Let's look at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>. They conducted 5,000
inspections before the crash. Only after the crash, after the
public scrutiny, after the media started digging and after some
whistle blowers came forward was there action.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Jordan</ENAMEX> defended his airline.
<p>
   ``Some have suggested that because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> charges lower fares,
the safety of the airline is also lower,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> told lawmakers.
``This is patently false. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> is able to offer low fares
because we cut frills. We have not and will never cut corners when
it comes to safety.''
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Stempler</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AirTrav Advisers</ENAMEX>, an air
travel consulting firm, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> should ground <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>
permanently, which would keep the carrier's owners and senior
management ``from ever operating an airline in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>
again.''
<p>
   ``This would be a fitting penalty,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stempler</ENAMEX> said, ``for a
group of high-risk, financial entrepreneurs who have brought us
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>, which ... was an accident waiting to happen.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX> told lawmakers that investigators of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National
Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> have not found a link between the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> crash and sloppy maintenance by outside contractors
discovered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> in its post-crash review.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Hall</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> should have learned of
the potential dangers of outside maintenance contractors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years
ago</TIMEX>.
<p>
   He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> first cautioned the agency on the matter in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>, when a DC-6 operated by a small regional carrier crashed near
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Van Nuys</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX> He said workers for a maintenance contractor had
improperly installed a propeller blade on the plane.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> added that the government must look carefully again at what
he called ``virtual airlines''  &MD;  carriers that provide
transportation but conduct none of their own maintenance or
training.
<p>
   ``We will analyze how carriers that outsource these services are
ensuring the safety of their operations,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William S. Cohen</ENAMEX>, R-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX>, chairman of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> committee
that oversees government management, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> told lawmakers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a
decade ago</TIMEX> that it was troubled by poor maintenance standards at
start-up carriers.
<p>
   ``Perhaps the biggest single problem our inspector work force
has faced is the management of new entrants,'' assistant
administrator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broderick</ENAMEX> told a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> panel in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>. ``The
proliferation of contract maintenance has been difficult to deal
with and has caused a large workload.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> committee <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>: ``Contract maintenance
is not a new trend, but an old problem that has gone unaddressed
and unsolved.''

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">BOSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Less than 24 hours after a publicity parachute jump
turned tragic, controversy surfaced over the cause  &MD;  whether the

the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honeymoon in Vegas Skydiving Exhibition Team</ENAMEX>, died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston City Hospital</ENAMEX> of injuries suffered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>'s jump
to mark the grand opening of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WaterWorks</ENAMEX>, an entertainment complex
at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marina Bay</ENAMEX> in nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quincy</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sayles</ENAMEX>, 41, suffered severe head injuries when he landed on an
embankment by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savin Hill Yacht Club</ENAMEX> parking lot, a mile short
of the chutists' target across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dorchester Bay</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   A second chutist, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Bozarth</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Henderson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nev.</ENAMEX>, was in
stable condition at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston City Hospital</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last night</TIMEX>. The other two
 &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas LaRochelle</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brookline</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.H.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las
Vegas</ENAMEX>  &MD;  landed unhurt in the water behind the yacht club.
<p>
   The accident left many wondering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> what went wrong. Some
sources suggested the parachutists had been dropped at the wrong
spot. And the pilot pointed to winds bounced from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>
skyscrapers as a possible explanation.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy Komich</ENAMEX>, a club member, who helped pull <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Head</ENAMEX> from the
water, said it was ``definitely too windy'' for the jump and also
said he thinks the parachutists were ``badly dropped''  &MD;  that is,
too far from their destination.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Mayer</ENAMEX>, 49, who piloted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cessna</ENAMEX> 182A vintage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1952</TIMEX>
aircraft modified for skydiving, said that from his vantage point
the jump appeared to be ``excellent.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayer</ENAMEX>, a parachuter with
1,500 jumps who works for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepperell Skydiving Center</ENAMEX>, said there is
no way he could have confused the marina locations.
<p>
   ``When you are looking from the air, there is no doubt where you
are,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayer</ENAMEX>, who recalled seeing lights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marina Bay</ENAMEX>
parking lot and people gathering for the exhibition. ``It's pretty
precise.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Feeney</ENAMEX>, president and owner of a rival group, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flying
Elvi</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>, said the wind conditions should have stopped the
jump. ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flying Elvi</ENAMEX> would never have jumped in those high wind
conditions,'' he said.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Bangs</ENAMEX>, director of safety and training with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United
States Parachute Association</ENAMEX>, said weather conditions were ``well
within limits.'' He also said licensed divers are not barred from
jumping in strong winds  &MD;  no matter how high. ``It appears as if it
was safe for them to jump,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bangs</ENAMEX> said, adding that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sayles</ENAMEX> was the
23d member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USPA</ENAMEX> to die in an accident <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Weather Service</ENAMEX> said winds were blowing to the
southeast at 15 m.p.h. with gusts up to 23 m.p.h. at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9 p.m.</TIMEX> A
service spokesman said surface wind measurements do not reflect how
strong winds thousands of feet up might have been.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayer</ENAMEX> said the plane left suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norwood Airport</ENAMEX> about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8 p.m.</TIMEX>
and hovered over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dorchester Bay</ENAMEX> about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8:15 p.m.</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayer</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   He said a wind drift indicator  &MD;  a fluorescent yellow crepe
paper 10 inches by 20 feet  &MD;  was dropped from the plane to
determine where the plane should position itself for the chutists
to make the target  &MD;  the parking lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marina Bay</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayer</ENAMEX> said the indicator landed within a mile of the target,
making it a good condition for a jump. The plane climbed to 5,000
feet and the chutists prepared to jump, patting each other on the
back, wishing each other a safe jump.
<p>
   ``I looked down at that point and their exit point was exactly
where it should have been,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayer</ENAMEX> said. ``I was thinking: `They're
going to have an excellent jump.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayer</ENAMEX> said he did not see the jumpers land because he had to
return to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" MIN="Norwood">Norwood airport</ENAMEX> and was stunned when he learned of the
mishap. He said winds near cities can be unpredictable.
<p>
   ``Windshear could be one of the factors,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayer</ENAMEX> said. ``If you
were in the ocean, you would have a steady wind ... In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>, the
wind bounces off skyscrapers and the smoothness of the wind is
disrupted. Even as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quincy</ENAMEX> wind is disrupted. We judge the
best we can.''
<p>
   Wednesday the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> began its probe. ``They will look at any
violation of regulations,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> spokeswoman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arlene Salac</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Federal aviation regulations prohibit parachuting between sunset
and sunrise unless the jumper is equipped with a light that is
visible for three miles. The regulations also oversee the packing
of parachutes and whether parachutists can jump over densely
settled areas or in controlled airspace.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salac</ENAMEX> said the jumpers had obtained appropriate permits to jump
in the restricted airspace, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Terminal Control Area</ENAMEX>, a
20-mile diameter around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan Airport</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``Everything was fine with the waiver,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salac</ENAMEX> said, ``so they
will be looking at the chutes.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Kane</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eating Up the Coast</ENAMEX>, the parent company of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WaterWorks</ENAMEX>, said the jumpers were paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8,500</NUMEX> and the contract
allowed them to call it off if they deemed it dangerous for weather
reasons. ``It was their call,'' he said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Cocco</ENAMEX>, director of operations for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eating Up the Coast</ENAMEX>,
added: ``We handled every single possible thing we were supposed
to. We told them: `Don't jump if you don't want to jump.' ''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelly Smith</ENAMEX>, manager of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honeymoon</ENAMEX> group, was unavailable for
comment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Fayette Taylor</ENAMEX>, an engineer who was one of the last
living links to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> brothers era of aviation and helped to
design the engine for the plane that carried <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles A. Lindbergh</ENAMEX>
across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>, died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 22</TIMEX> at his home in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Weston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX> He
was 101.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> was on the faculty at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Institute of
Technology</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1926 until his retirement in 1960</TIMEX>. His two-volume
text, ``The Internal Combustion Engine in Theory and Practice,''
written several decades ago, remains a primary reference for
automotive engineers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> said in announcing his death.
<p>
   In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1920s</TIMEX>, just after graduating from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale University</ENAMEX>
with a degree in mechanical engineering and while in charge of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Service Laboratory</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dayton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> was
introduced to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orville Wright</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Soon he was working for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wright Aeronautical Corp.</ENAMEX>, where he was
in charge of airplane-engine design and development <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1923 to
1926</TIMEX>. He was on the team that designed the air-cooled Whirlwind
engine for The Spirit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, the craft built by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ryan
Airlines</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindbergh</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New-York</ENAMEX>-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> flight in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1927</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Knowing full well that his life depended on the engine (and his
ability to stay awake for the 33 and a half hours of the flight),
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindbergh</ENAMEX> fussed over its assembly. According to one account, a
mechanic accidentally cracked a cooling fin. Not content to have
the single fin replaced, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindbergh</ENAMEX> wanted a whole new section of
engine.
<p>
   ``Why?'' the mechanic asked.
<p>
   ``Because I don't swim so well,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindbergh</ENAMEX> replied.
<p>
   On the trip east before the trans-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> flight, the engine
coughed a bit over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rocky Mountains</ENAMEX>. More ominously, it was
running <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5 percent</NUMEX> below full power on the wet, chilly <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 20, 1927</TIMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindbergh</ENAMEX> revved it on a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> airfield,
mulling whether to take off for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   One last check showed everything in order. Mechanics figured the
engine was being momentarily slowed by the elements.
<p>
   The plane took off and the engine worked just fine, even through
1,000 miles of snow and sleet over the ocean.
<p>
   As a boy in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montclair</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, where his
family moved when he was 11, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Taylor</ENAMEX> was fascinated by
airplanes. His drawings were like blueprints, his mother recalled
years later.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>, he entered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX>, receiving a bachelor's degree in
philosophy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1915</TIMEX>. In World War I, he was an inspector of aircraft
material for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal Corps</ENAMEX> for three months before being put in
charge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeronautical Engine Laboratory</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>.
He returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> after the war and received an engineering
degree in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1920</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> as an associate professor of aeronautical
engineering in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1926</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three years later</TIMEX>, he was a full professor and
head of aeronautical engineering. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX>, he was named professor
of mechanical engineering and director of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sloan Laboratory
for Aircraft and Automotive Engines</ENAMEX>, a post he held until his
retirement in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> and his wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice</ENAMEX>, were honored for creating
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Educational Counseling Committee of Boston</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1940s</TIMEX>
and helping more than 2,000 black children attend college.
<p>
   Just before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="100th birthday">his 100th birthday</TIMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 24, 1994</TIMEX>, he was asked
what it meant to live a century. ``I saw Halley's Comet twice,'' he
replied. He had, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1910</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Surviving are his wife, who is 98; a son, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Carlos</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>; seven grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren. Another
son, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Jr.</ENAMEX>, died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</TIMEX>.

RUDDER SWINGS MAY HAVE CAUSED CRASHES OF 737S
(lb)

<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Air-safety investigators struggling with two
unsolved crashes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737s said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that an incident
involving another 737 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> could provide important clues.
<p>
   In the incident <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>, the plane unexpectedly rolled to one
side after a movement by the rudder that the pilot did not ask for
 &MD;  the same sequence that investigators believe happened in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1994</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> Flight 427, which crashed on its approach
to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>, killing all 132 aboard.
<p>
   The same sequence may have also happened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1991</TIMEX> to a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> 737 that crashed as it was approaching <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado
Springs</ENAMEX>, killing all 25 aboard.
<p>
   Like the two planes that crashed, the aircraft in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>'s
incident, a 25-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737 belonging to a small new
carrier, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastwind Airlines</ENAMEX>, carried a primitive flight-data
recorder that did not capture many details of the incident. The
plane was bought from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> and is still maintained by that
airline.
<p>
   Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> crash, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety
Board</ENAMEX> has been studying all ``uncommanded roll'' incidents in 737s,
in which one of the wings dips unexpectedly. Investigators have
looked at more than 50 such incidents, but this is the first since
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> crash that they cannot explain.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="June 9">Late on June 9</TIMEX>, in calm, clear weather as the plane was
approaching <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Richmond</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, on a flight from the airline's
headquarters in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Trenton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, the pilot felt what he described as
a ``bump'' on the rudder, and then a more substantial swing as the
plane rolled to the right.
<p>
   The captain told the investigators that he ``stood on the
opposite rudder pedal'' to try to correct the roll, and extended
the ailerons  &MD;  the flight-control panels on the wing surfaces  &MD; 
nearly all the way. The plane landed without injury to the 48
passengers and crew of five.
<p>
   In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> case the flight-data recorder and cockpit
voice recorder do not make clear what happened, but engineers say
the plane's trajectory could be explained by a sudden swing of the
rudder all the way to one side.
<p>
   Engineers still do not know what could have made the rudder
swing that way, but they believe that the problem may be centered
on the standby rudder actuator, which is the only part of the
rudder assembly on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastwind</ENAMEX> plane that was not replaced as they
dealt with a series of problems in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>.
<p>
   On new planes, flight-data recorders generally track more than
100 different kinds of data, but the one on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastwind</ENAMEX> plane
tracks only 11, as did the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> plane.
<p>
   In a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Hall</ENAMEX>,
the chairman of the safety board, said, ``Under slightly different
circumstances, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastwind</ENAMEX> incident could have become a third
fatal B-737 upset accident for which there was inadequate
flight-data recorder information to determine the cause.''
<p>
   The letter, sent on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> and made public <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, noted that
the board had asked on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 22, 1995</TIMEX>, that such recorders be
installed by the end of last year.
<p>
   The safety board had asked for immediate action on early 737s
and improvements over a longer period on other old planes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>
combined the two recommendations and drafted a single proposed
rule.
<p>
   In a statement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> the agency said it agreed with
the intent of the safety board's recommendations on flight-data
recorders and was still working on a proposal.
<p>
   Airlines have complained that wiring their planes to capture
additional data, like the position of the rudder and the position
of the rudder-control pedals in the cockpit, would mean taking them
out of revenue-producing service for long periods.
<p>
   The accidents are particularly troubling because more than 2,400
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737s are in use.
<p>
   According to the safety board, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastwind</ENAMEX> plane had three
earlier problems with its rudder. Shortly before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 10</TIMEX>
incident, most of the critical parts of the rudder-control system
had been replaced, except for a part called the standby rudder
actuator.
<p>
   This is normally used only in back-up mode and is part of the
yaw damper, an automatic system that swings the rudder up to 3
degrees in either direction to keep the plane pointed in the
direction it is traveling.
<p>
   The yaw damper may have been ``misrigged,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>'s letter said,
and could have pushed the rudder up to 4.5 degrees.
<p>
   Standby rudder actuators have been known to stick if metal parts
inside rub together and metal from the softer surface accumulates.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX> and others have insisted until now that such a
failure cannot cause the rudder to bend by more than 3 degrees.
<p>
   In this case, apparently because of a maintenance error, instead
of having 3 degrees of movement to either side, it was 1.5 degrees
to one side and 4.5 to the other. This is the first time
investigators have found a mechanism for a swing of more than 3
degrees, but both planes evidently experienced an even larger
rudder movement.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NEW YORK</ENAMEX>  &MD;  A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines</ENAMEX> 747 bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New
York City</ENAMEX> plunged in a fireball into the waters off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> with more than 200 people aboard.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> said there were no survivors, and officials said
there was no immediate indication of what caused the crash.
<p>
   The plane, Flight 800, went down at around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:45 p.m.</TIMEX>, on a
partly cloudy night minutes after taking off from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">John F. Kennedy
International Airport</ENAMEX>. It crashed about 20 miles from the airport
and sank into the waters off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moriches Inlet</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Center Moriches</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Suffolk County</ENAMEX> on the eastern end of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> said there were 249 passengers and a crew of 32
aboard the flight, which was scheduled to leave <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 p.m.</TIMEX>
and was expected to arrive at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charles DeGaulle Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> at
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:15</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> said there were 229 people
aboard. The plane had come in from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX> as Flight 881.
<p>
   Witnesses spoke of a light dropping swiftly from the sky and
then either one or two bursts of flame and an enormous black cloud.
As the plane spiraled toward the water, they said they saw pieces
peel off.
<p>
   ``There were two explosions, bright red up in the air,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Keshal</ENAMEX>, who lives right along the shore in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Center Moriches</ENAMEX>.
``There was a lot of flames and redness in the air. And a lot of
smoke. A lot of smoke.''
<p>
   He said he didn't actually see anything resembling an airplane,
but ``two separate red areas coming out of the sky.''
<p>
   Even several hours after the crash, debris from the plane could
be seen burning in the water as rescue boats surrounded it.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie Marlow</ENAMEX>, who lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Moriches</ENAMEX> and had been fishing
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moriches Inlet</ENAMEX>, said, ``There was a great fire, like a fireball.
Eventually the plane just spread apart, and there was a loud thump.
I felt the tremor when it hit the water.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Debbie Walsh</ENAMEX>, who was at a restaurant within view of the crash,
said, ``It looked like a ball of fire falling into the water. It
was a ball of fire and then the plane trailed down and seemed to
break into two pieces.'' She added, ``It was trails of flame going
down to the water.''
<p>
   People on pleasure boats in the general vicinity of the crash
reported seeing bodies bobbing in the water alongside fragments of
the plane still on fire.
<p>
   The plunging ball of fire was apparently visible as far away as
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dune Road</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Westhampton Beach</ENAMEX>, and people said they could feel the
shock wave 10 to 12 miles from the crash.
<p>
   ``We are not finding any survivors,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> Chief Petty
Officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Sapp</ENAMEX> was quoted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Associated Press</ENAMEX> as saying.
``We are locating lots of bodies out there.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> planes dropped life rafts in the waters
shortly after the crash. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coaat Guard</ENAMEX> said that six helicopters,
three cutters and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> P-3 plane were dispatched to the scene.
<p>
   On the beaches fronting the inlet, a temporary morgue was set up
by rescue officials.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> would not confirm that there
was an explosion, saying only that it lost radar contact with the
aircraft at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8:45 p.m.</TIMEX> The plane was under the control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston
Air Traffic Control Center</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The possibility that there was an explosion aboard the plane
raised the obvious possibility that terrorism was involved, and
federal law-enforcement officials said they were looking into that
possibility. But there are other possible causes for an explosion
as well, such as a problem with an engine, and it may be weeks or
even months before a final determination is made.
<p>
   If terrorism was involved, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> would have jurisdiction over
the investigation into the cause of the blast.
<p>
   But the officials cautioned that they had no definitive evidence
suggesting what caused the downing of the plane, and said that it
would probably be many hours before they got a clear fix on what
happened. One federal official, however, said, ``It doesn't look
good,'' meaning that the circumstances seemed to point to a
terrorist act.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> was mobilizing agents on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> from its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New
York</ENAMEX> field office to help identify victims and to work with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>
to help determine the cause of the crash.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ira Furman</ENAMEX>, a former investigator for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National
Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>, urged caution about early reports of
explosions. ``We have found reports of explosions unreliable,'' he
said. ``I can suggest that sometimes an explosion is really
connected with a flameout, like a backfire in a car.''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> said that a team from
its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> office was securing the beaches bordering the waters
where the crash occurred. An additional team from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> was
expected to arrive at the site on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The aircraft, a 747 Model 100, is the world's first jumbo jet
and was flown for the first time in 1969. The 100 designation makes
it one of the older 747 models. It is 232 feet long, with a
wingspan of 196 feet. The plane can cruise at 600 miles and hour,
with a range of nearly 760 miles.
<p>
   The aircraft can be configured to carry as many as 516
passengers, although it was unclear how many people the plane that
crashed was set up to contain.
<p>
   The plane had come in from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX> as Flight 881.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> said the plane had climbed to 13,000 feet before it
disappeared from the radar screen.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> sent counterterrorism investigators to the scene, which
is normally done in instances where there is a possibility of an
attack.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 18</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> investigators continued to
probe what caused a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines Inc.</ENAMEX> jumbo jet to explode
and plummet into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX> with 228 people aboard <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last
night</TIMEX>. There were no reports of survivors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX> reported that about
100 bodies have been found.
<p>
   Officials said they haven't ruled out terrorism as a cause of
the blast on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747-100 jet, which came after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>
heightened security as a precaution ahead of the Olympic Games in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``We have no reason to believe that there was a threat against
the aircraft,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Abels</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> spokesman, said at a press
conference. He also said the company doesn't believe there were any
problems with the aircraft.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abels</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> wouldn't release a complete list of passengers
until all family members were notified. He said there were 210
passengers on board. The rest were flight attendants and crew.
<p>
   President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> warned Americans not to jump to conclusions
about the cause of the crash.
<p>
   ``We do not know what caused this tragedy,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> said.
``Let's wait until we see the evidence. We will find out what
happened.''
<p>
   Eyewitnesses described a series of explosions before the plane
fell.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">navy</ENAMEX> was sending a crew to retrieve the plane's black boxes,
which could be about 100 feet under water, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> Minority
Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Gephardt</ENAMEX>. The crash site is about 20 miles off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New
York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> Representative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Forbes</ENAMEX>, speaking near the crash
site, said he was told divers had retrieved one of the two black
boxes.
<p>
   Search teams retrieved passengers' belongings and parts of the
engine, wings and a 30-foot piece of the fuselage.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Bureau of Investigation</ENAMEX> is leading the investigation
into whether the explosion was ``the result of criminal activity,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Hall</ENAMEX>, the chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety
Board</ENAMEX>, told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Attorney General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> was looking into two
suspicious telephone calls made after the crash that may have been
related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> crash.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800, bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, disappeared from radar screens
around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:40 p.m. local time</TIMEX> shortly after taking off from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New
York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">John F. Kennedy Airport</ENAMEX>. Among the passengers was a party of
16 teenagers from a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> high school.
<p>
   Experts say the maximum survival period in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX> at
65 degrees Fahrenheit is 12 hours.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abels</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> spokesman, said the plane was delayed about an
hour because of confusion over a passenger's luggage and the
breakdown of a piece of ground equipment that had to be towed from
the runway.
<p>
   The 25-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> aircraft was bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charles de
Gaulle Airport</ENAMEX>. The plane had flown <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier yesterday</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greece</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takis Tassopoulous</ENAMEX>, the head of Greek aviation security, told
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX> that his office had no warnings of terrorist activity in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> released the names of some crew members. These included
Capt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Snyder</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> pilot since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Campell</ENAMEX>, flight
engineer; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver Krick</ENAMEX>, recently hired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> and on the plane
as an observer as part of his flight engineer training.
<p>
   The crash comes two months after a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet Inc.</ENAMEX> plane exploded
and crashed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida Everglades</ENAMEX>, killing all 110 people
aboard. That plane was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas Corp.</ENAMEX> DC-9.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> was grounded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the Federal Aviation
Administration</ENAMEX> one month after the crash.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Stempler</ENAMEX>, an aviation consultant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, said
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, already under fire for its monitoring of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>, will
face tough questions about its safety regulations as a result of
the latest crashes.
<p>
   Passengers will have a ``you better get it right this time''
attitude toward both the airlines and the agency, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stempler</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   A <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> airliner has never been brought down with a bomb planted
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> A terrorist bomb that blew up a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> flight over
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1988</TIMEX> originated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, hidden
in a cassette player.
<p>
   The crash comes less than a year after <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>
emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the airline's second
bankruptcy filing in two years.
<p>
   The carrier has become competitive again by paring costs and
pulling out of money-losing routes. The 72-year-old carrier earlier
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> reported an almost fivefold increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">second-quarter</TIMEX>
net income to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25.3 million</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">46 cents</NUMEX> a share.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> has had a good safety record, industry analysts say.
<p>
   The plane that crashed was bought in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> spokesman
said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> produced that model of the world's largest airliner
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1970 through 1986</TIMEX>. It holds about 360 passengers in three
classes.
<p>
   ``It's too soon to get any hard data on what happened,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Webb</ENAMEX>. ``We will cooperate fully with any
investigation.''
<p>
   All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747-100 planes use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pratt &AMP; Whitney</ENAMEX> JT9D engines, said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Sullivan</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pratt &AMP; Whitney</ENAMEX>, which is a unit of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Technologies Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> said the engine, in use since
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>, hasn't experienced any problems ``that would be considered
out of the ordinary for airline operations.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pratt &AMP; Whitney</ENAMEX> has sent a crash investigator to the site,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> shares fell 1 to 10 1/4 in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midafternoon</TIMEX> trading of 5.2
million shares, far more than the three-month daily average of
885,700 shares.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> shares rose 1 5/8 to 86 7/8, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Technologies</ENAMEX>
gained 2 3/4 to 107 3/4.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Jenkins</ENAMEX>, vice chairman of the international security firm
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kroll Associates</ENAMEX>, said airport security measures have improved
significantly in recent years, in the wake of terrorist attacks.
<p>
   ``As the result of extraordinary security measures, commercial
aviation, which was once one of the most popular targets of
international terrorism, was made a more difficult target,'' he
said.
<p>
   He said attempts to hijack or plant bombs aboard aircraft have
decreased. Deaths in crashes, however, have increased markedly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this
year</TIMEX>, according to Flight International magazine, to 609 in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first six months</TIMEX> from 206 in the same period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   A toll-free number has been set up for family members of people
on the flight. The number is (800) 438-9892.

AVIATION EXPERTS POINT TO TERRORISM AS LIKELY CAUSE OF CRASH
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYTimes News Service</ENAMEX> clients)
By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MICHAEL D. TOWLE</ENAMEX>
c.<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</ENAMEX>
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Aviation experts pointed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> to a terrorist
attack as the most likely cause of the explosion and fiery crash of
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> jumbo jet into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX> off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   But they did not rule out mechanical failure, such as the
explosion of one of the four engines on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747-100, and
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> warned against snap conclusions.
<p>
   ``I want to caution the American people we have no evidence ...
that would indicate the cause of the accident,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   ``And I want to remind you that when we had the terrible tragedy
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX>, a lot of people immediately concluded that this
must have been done by some force outside our country, and it
appears that that was not the case now.''
<p>
   But aviation and terrorism experts said eyewitness accounts and
information so far available on the crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800 point
to a bomb as the cause.
<p>
   ``It appears to have been an instantaneous, huge explosion,''
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Lawrence</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> aviation expert and former
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> pilot who investigated aviation accidents for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>. ``If I had to bet, I would bet it was a bomb.''
<p>
   Among the reasons for that conclusion:
<p>
   Eyewitnesses seem to say unanimously that the Paris-bound plane
plunged into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> in a ball of fire.
<p>
   The wreckage, judging from pictures available through the media,
was in small pieces, a sign of the explosive force of a bomb.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747, despite some high-profile mishaps, is considered
one of the world's safest aircraft.
<p>
   The crash came two days before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this evening</TIMEX>'s opening of the
Olympic Games in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, a factor that might have figured in
terrorists' planning if they were indeed behind the crash.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSNBC</ENAMEX>, the new interactive news service from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Corp.</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX>, reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late Thursday</TIMEX> on the World Wide Web that
investigators were looking at radar tapes to examine ``possible
activity outside the 747 when it went down.''
<p>
   The tapes may reveal another object, possibly a missile,
collided with the plane, the report said.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX> acknowledged that there could be several possible
causes for the crash.
<p>
   ``If an engine did come apart, it may have sent a hot piece
through a fuel tank,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX> said. ``It could also have been
carrying some kind of hazardous cargo that would have caused an
explosion.''
<p>
   Oxygen generators carried as cargo aboard a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> DC-9 have
been cited as a probable cause of the plane's crash on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11</TIMEX> in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida Everglades</ENAMEX>. All 110 people on board were killed.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX> said it was unusual for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800 to have
disappeared from radar screens with no emergency communications
from the crew.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> officials said the plane left <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy Airport</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:19 p.m.</TIMEX>
CDT and disappeared by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:48 p.m.</TIMEX> with ``no non-routine
transmissions.''
<p>
   The crash was reminiscent of the downing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> Flight 103 on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 21, 1988</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747 exploded over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>,
less than an hour into its flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. No
distress signals were received from its crew and witnesses reported
seeing fireballs in the sky.
<p>
   Within hours of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> crash, investigators suspected a
bomb. The plane exploded suddenly at 31,000 feet and an Iranian
group claimed responsibility. Federal officials had been cautioned
that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> flight on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> route was a target
for bombing.
<p>
   Investigators later found that the bomb was made of plastic
explosive hidden in a radio-cassette recorder in a suitcase. That
bomb was triggered by a device set for a specific altitude.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Louden</ENAMEX>, a terrorism expert at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John Jay College</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New
York</ENAMEX>, said several signs point to terrorism in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> crash, but
that so far there is no hard evidence.
<p>
   He noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> immediately dispatched members of its
explosives unit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. The agents should be able to determine
if an explosive device was used by looking for residue of explosive
material on debris and even on the bodies of victims.
<p>
   ``Because of the possibility of terrorism, you absolutely have
to start looking right away,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louden</ENAMEX> said. ``If it does turn out
to be that, you haven't lost time or potential evidence.''
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louden</ENAMEX> said the crash could have been caused by someone
without political motives.
<p>
   ``It could be man-caused, but not terrorist related,'' he said.
``There could be some other motivation for someone wanting to
accomplish the same end. There are any number of motivating
factors: terrorism, suicide, insurance, and it could have been just
one person bent on any of the above.''
<p>
   Attorney General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX> said two telephone calls from people
claiming responsibility were received after the plane went down.
<p>
   Television station <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTSP</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tampa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, received a call at about
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:45 Thursday morning</TIMEX> from someone whom station officials said
claimed to be a member of a Jihad, or ``holy war.'' The station
notified <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tampa</ENAMEX> police and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">FBI</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louden</ENAMEX> said it is not unusual for a group, or pranksters, to
take credit for a deadly event after the fact.
<p>
   ``Often, it is one group trying to get their name in the ring,''
he said.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">KANSAS CITY</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mo.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The deadly explosion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800 spread
a pall over the airline's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX> overhaul base <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``We lost a lot of good people on that airplane,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Tyler</ENAMEX>,
a base mechanic, said as he sat at nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allie's Bar &AMP; Grill</ENAMEX> after
his work shift ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>. ``It's heart saddening.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> records show that the jet that
crashed near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> paid what were considered routine visits to
the base, the airline's primary site for plane maintenance.
<p>
   Base workers said they and their colleagues wore Walkman radios
much of the work day, listening for word of what ignited the 747
explosion.
<p>
   The cause of the crash was unknown, and that uncertainty grated
on the beefy, bearded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyler</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``I would hate to think that this was maintenance,'' he said
over the muted babblings of a TV talk show. ``As long as I've
worked at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>, I've never seen bad maintenance. Everybody's so
conscientious. The training takes years. It's not something you go
to night school for.''
<p>
   Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> workers at the bar described the mood at the base as
``pretty somber.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Lacy</ENAMEX>, a mechanic who has worked at the base nearly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30
years</TIMEX>, was subdued and somewhat stoic about the tragedy.
<p>
   ``I'm sorry for all those people that got killed,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lacy</ENAMEX> said.
``It's just one of those things. It could have been a bomb or
anything. You don't know what happened....There's nothing else I
can do.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathy Woodward</ENAMEX>, a bartender and waitress at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Final Approach
Pub</ENAMEX> near the base, said she served fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> employees than normal
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``The (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>) people I had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> were very down,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodward</ENAMEX> said
amid the bar's vast collection of airline memorabilia. ``They were
glued to the TV. People were not themselves.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyler</ENAMEX>, who overhauls pumps that move fuel from the wings to the
engine, said working on aircraft is a high-pressure job, ``probably
right below being a doctor.''
<p>
   ``We take people's lives in our hands,'' he said. ``We don't
take it lightly. I'll stand behind every pump I ever build. When I
go home to sleep <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX>, I'll know that isn't what caused that
crash.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyler</ENAMEX> insisted that the crash wouldn't impede <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>'s financial
recovery after years of losses: ``We're coming back, and everybody
knows we're coming back.''
<p>
   Mechanics and other rank-and-file workers at the base belong to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Machinists Local 1650</ENAMEX>, which is overseen by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Machinists District
142</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Poos</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">District 142</ENAMEX> official, said the union is ``fully
participating in this investigation.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poos</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William O'Driscoll</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">District 142</ENAMEX>, was at
the command post in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poos</ENAMEX> said the union's ``deepest sympathy goes to the families
and friends of those who perished in this tragedy.''

EXPERTS SKEPTICAL THAT A STINGER MISSILE DOWNED <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> JET

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Weapons experts said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> it's unlikely that a
Stinger surface-to-air missile brought down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Beaver</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jane's Information Group Limited</ENAMEX>,
publishers of books on weapons, noted a lack of evidence that any
missile was involved in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> explosion and crash of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beaver</ENAMEX> also expressed skepticism that a hand-held <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-made
Stinger anti-aircraft missile could have downed the jumbo jet.
<p>
   Some eyewitnesses said they saw a bright light moving toward the
jet just before it exploded over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX> shortly after
it had taken off from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">John F. Kennedy Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, leading
to speculation that a missile may have been responsible. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> said
230 passengers and crew were killed in the incident.
<p>
   However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beaver</ENAMEX> said several factors make him think the weapon
``couldn't possibly have been used.''
<p>
   For one thing, the Stinger's maximum altitude is about 12,400
feet, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> jet exploded at an altitude of around 13,700,
he noted.
<p>
   Furthermore, the missile has a maximum range of about 2.8 miles,
while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> plane was about 10 miles offshore. The missile would
have to have been fired from a boat, a still more difficult
maneuver.
<p>
   In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beaver</ENAMEX> said batteries used in the missiles have
only a 10-year life and may have failed by now.
<p>
   ``You need to be an expert to operate it,'' he said. ``You need
to smuggle it into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> or to have obtained it
illegally in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>,'' he added.
<p>
   Noting that a shoulder-fired Stinger, including its heat-seeking
missile and launcher, weighs about 44 pounds and is 60 inches long,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beaver</ENAMEX> called it ``a conspicuous piece of merchandise.''
<p>
   Arms control experts have been concerned about an estimated
1,000 Stinger missiles the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> shipped to Afghan rebels
in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1980s</TIMEX> to help them shoot down Soviet helicopters.
<p>
   After the war, several hundred unused Stingers began spreading
to other countries and terrorist groups. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> effort with a
reported budget of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$55 million</NUMEX> to buy back the missiles has been
largely unsuccessful, instead boosting the black-market price of
the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30,000</NUMEX> missiles to more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100,000</NUMEX>, experts say.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William D. Hartung</ENAMEX>, a specialist in the global arms market at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New School for Social Research</ENAMEX>, called the spread of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-made Stingers ``a case of unintended consequences.''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> provided the weapons to the anti-communist
Afghan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mujahedeen</ENAMEX> ``for one purpose, ejecting the Soviets, but they
didn't think about the character of the movement that they were
giving it to, which was a right-wing fundamentalist Islamic
movement which was involved in training Islamic fighters from all
over the world,'' he said.
<p>
   While that helps explain how the Stingers originally shipped to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> spread to terrorist groups throughout the world,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hartung</ENAMEX> said it's ``unbelievable that someone could park themselves
on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> with a Stinger missile and take out an airliner.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Natalie J. Goldring</ENAMEX>, deputy director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British American
Security Information Council</ENAMEX>, a non-profit research group, also
expressed skepticism that a Stinger was responsible.
<p>
   ``I think we've been lucky,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldring</ENAMEX> said. ``I am one of those
people who has been saying for a long time that this is the sort of
system that can come back to haunt us.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldring</ENAMEX> said ``every Stinger that is in another country's hands
is a Stinger that can be used against civilian aircraft.''
<p>
   But she, too, said she thinks it's unlikely that a Stinger was
used to down the jumbo jet. ``The more that advanced technology is
used in a system, the shorter its shelf life tends to be,'' she
said.
<p>
   While pistols from World War I can still be found in working
order, ``advanced portable surface-to-air missiles are a lot more
complicated,'' she said.
<p>
   Terrorism expert <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Livingstone</ENAMEX> said it's too early to rule
out any explanation for the explosion, but he said a missile
appears unlikely. On the other hand, he said, at least a dozen
terrorist groups have surface-to-air missiles.
<p>
   While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> officials have discounted reports that radar
showed a small object approaching the plane just before it
exploded, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beaver</ENAMEX> said a missile like the Stinger wouldn't
necessarily show up on radar.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Pike</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federation of American Scientists</ENAMEX> said that
even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> plane was outside the range of a Stinger, ``that
would by no means rule out this thing being done by a
surface-to-air missile,'' other than a Stinger, perhaps fired from
a boat.
<p>
   ``There are other man-portable missiles ... that have a
significantly longer range,'' including the Russian SA-7 Grail
anti-aircraft missile, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pike</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldring</ENAMEX> said the mere speculation that a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-made weapon may
have been responsible for the explosion will bring attention to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> arms export policy.
<p>
   ``I think we need to think much more carefully about what kinds
of weapons we are supplying, especially to unstable and
undemocratic regimes,'' she said. ``The risks are just too high.''

SEAMAN KEEPS THINKING OF STUFFED TWEETIE BIRD FISHED FROM WATER
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times News Service</ENAMEX> clients.)

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EAST MORICHES</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Coonan</ENAMEX> had been at sea less than two
days when his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Coast Guard</ENAMEX> cutter was forced by rough weather
to abandon its search <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> for the remains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800.
<p>
   On his way back to port, the 19-year-old seaman kept thinking
about the four-foot, stuffed Tweetie Bird he had fished from the
water.
<p>
   ``I thought about a little kid sitting near his mom holding that
bird,'' he said. ``And then, it's over.''
<p>
   For <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coonan</ENAMEX> and 10 other crew members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> cutter
Point Wells, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past two days</TIMEX> have been unsettling. Their vessel,
once a patrol boat in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX>, was one of the first to arrive off
eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early Thursday</TIMEX>, just hours after the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747 exploded and plunged into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``You could smell it in the air. You knew something had
happened,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coonan</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vermont</ENAMEX> native.
<p>
   ``It was eerie when you know what's out there,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris
Biswurm</ENAMEX>, 23, another Point Wells crewman. ``We were just out there
steaming through this stuff.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Kreesim</ENAMEX>, a senior chief petty officer, said he had tried
to prepare his young crew for what he knew would be an emotionally
difficult task when the Point Wells left port. He even refused to
let the crew watch television, fearing it might distract them and
make their jobs even harder.
<p>
   ``We had a mission to concentrate on,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kreesim</ENAMEX>, 40.
<p>
   Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late Wednesday</TIMEX>, the Point Wells and hundreds of other
vessels have scoured the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>, looking for
bodies, plane debris and any possessions of the 230 people who
boarded the plane at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">John F. Kennedy Airport</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Search and rescue efforts were hampered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> by rain and heavy
seas.
<p>
   Waves as high as six feet forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> to recall some
of its smaller boats. Divers, who had been expected to begin their
search for debris on the ocean floor, were unable to get into the
water.
<p>
   Officials feared the turbulent water was spreading the debris
and moving some of it into deeper water, which would increase the
difficulty of retrieving bodies and wreckage.
<p>
   ``The weather is not playing in our favor,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair Thomas</ENAMEX>,
public affairs officer for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> is expected to bring in divers and special
equipment that can be lowered in the water to pick up the
high-pitched signal from the flight data recorders  &MD;  the so-called
black boxes  &MD;  aboard the aircraft.
<p>
   Meanwhile, residents have been reporting pieces of the wreckage
washing ashore.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed O'Connell</ENAMEX> found a charred tray table, the kind normally
attached to the rear of airplane seats, near his home about 15
miles from the crash site.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Connell</ENAMEX>, who showed reporters his find, said he figured it was
part of the plane when he noticed the wording ``Life Vest under
your seat'' etched on the tray bottom.
<p>
   Meanwhile, those who observed the jumbo jet exploding say they
still have vivid memories. Captain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Baur</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York
International Guard</ENAMEX>, was flying his helicopter when the plane went
down.
<p>
   ``There was an explosion followed by a bigger explosion followed
by a bigger explosion,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baur</ENAMEX> recalled. ``It spiraled down like a
corkscrew until it hit the ocean.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baur</ENAMEX> said he became aware of the magnitude of the loss when he
sighted as many as 80 bodies in the water.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 19</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation</ENAMEX> official said the agency hasn't taken over the probe
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>'s crash of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines Inc.</ENAMEX> jet that killed
230 people.
<p>
   However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Kallstrom</ENAMEX>, an investigator with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s
anti-terrorism task force, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> is treating the crash site
as a crime scene in case it later determines a crime was committed.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kallstrom</ENAMEX> said investigators haven't determined the cause and
are considering all possibilities. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747,
exploded and plunged into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX> off the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long
Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``If it is a terrorist act, we will find the cowards who did
this,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kallstrom</ENAMEX> said at a press conference near the crash site.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> hasn't delayed blaming the crash on a terrorist act due
to pressure from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> over the timing of the opening of
the Olympic games, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kallstrom</ENAMEX> said in a second press conference held
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>. ``We're not trying to be cute here. We're not
prepared to say something until we're sure it's absolutely true,''
he said. ``We're not discounting anything.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kallstrom</ENAMEX> added that it took six days before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1988</TIMEX>
crash of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> 747 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>, was labeled the
result of a bomb.
<p>
   He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> is working with overseas criminal investigation
agencies in the probe, which he described as ``massive.''
<p>
   The crash is the second-worst in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, after a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American
Airlines</ENAMEX> crash in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> that killed 273.
<p>
   The plane went down shortly after taking off from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">John F. Kennedy Airport</ENAMEX> bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charles de Gaulle
Airport</ENAMEX>. It had flown earlier from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greece</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier today</TIMEX>, a spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency</ENAMEX> confirmed it also is investigating the crash, looking for
clues that might suggest a foreign connection.
<p>
   ``We've been involved since the tragedy first occurred,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Mansfield</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> spokesman. He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> always looks at
incidents where involvement by a foreign person or group is
possible.
<p>
   At the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> press conference, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Francis</ENAMEX>, chairman of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>, said high winds and rough
seas had forced divers away from a spot at the crash site where a
large piece of the aircraft might be located, according to sonar
readings. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">This evening</TIMEX> he said less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 percent</NUMEX> of the wreckage
has been recovered so far.
<p>
   Earlier, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX> again slammed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> for
taking too long to present victims' families with a list of
confirmed fatalities.
<p>
   ``I heard a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> spokesman say that all the family members had
been notified by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> said. ``That's totally
false. They hadn't even compiled a list by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 o'clock</TIMEX>.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Erickson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>'s chief executive, responded to a question
about the delay by saying that the airline's trauma response team
had to be assembled from locations all over the country. He said
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> officials are currently working with family members in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erickson</ENAMEX> also said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last night</TIMEX>'s Flight 800 left fully loaded and
that the airline's advance bookings for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> remain strong.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> shares fell 3/4 to close at 9 1/2 on trading of 3.5 million
shares, much more than the three-month average of 997,100, but less
than half the 7.3 million shares traded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>.

similar questions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> and counting themselves lucky that there
were no injuries.
<p>
   Aside, that is, from damage to the nerves of the some 800
people, most attached to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> cavalry squadron, who were at the
base on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> when the bomb struck.
<p>
   ``We thought war was fixing to break out,'' said Pfc. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter
Sanders</ENAMEX>, who with his partner in a watchtower at the base, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Camp
McGovern</ENAMEX>, was probably the closest person to the explosion.
<p>
   Pfc. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Raile</ENAMEX> said, ``People's eyes were all wide trying to
figure out what happened.''
<p>
   Some soldiers said they thought that they were under artillery
attack. The base commander, Lt. Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Cucolo</ENAMEX>, said he thought
at first that it might be an attack by a renegade pilot from one of
the local Bosnian military forces. Others said they had no idea who
was shooting at them or with what.
<p>
   Soldiers said that for about 30 minutes until the situation was
clarified, they dove into bunkers and ran to firing positions
around the base, preparing to fire off mortars and getting ready
for the next step in what was generally thought to be an attack.
<p>
   But even the truth was of only limited comfort. Spc. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Orr</ENAMEX>
said he had thought of soldiers killed by alleid fire during the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> Persian Gulf war. He said: ``It makes you think, `Here we go
again.' ''
<p>
   Military officials said the bomb fell from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> FA-18 jet,
also known as a Hornet, in which the pilot was practicing bombing
runs near the base so as to be able to protect the troops there in
case they came under attack by ground forces.
<p>
   The drill did not entail dropping a bomb, only practicing
coordination between the aircraft and controllers on the ground.
But as the jet, which was based on the carrier Enterprise in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Adriatic</ENAMEX>, flew over the base, the bomb fell, exploding on a remote
section of a large mound of dirt that runs around most of the base.
<p>
   It missed three large freight containers holding ammunition by
about 200 feet.
<p>
   About half of the bomb's weight was the metal casing, so 250
pounds of explosive shook the ground, sending concussion waves
against the soldiers and 250 pounds of metal fragments through part
of the base. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> spokesman said, however, that there was almost
no damage from either the explosion or shrapnel.
<p>
   There have been no fatalities as a result of hostile action
among the 16,500 American peacekeepers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosnia</ENAMEX> since they began
arriving in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The base, just southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brcko</ENAMEX>, is in a particularly tense
area of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosnia</ENAMEX>, in the three-mile wide strip of land that separates
Bosnian government and Bosnia Serb territory.
<p>
   There has been fairly constant friction between the Muslim and
Serbian authorities here. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX>, three war-damaged houses that
were being rebuilt by their Muslim owners on the Serbian side were
dynamited, presumably by Serbs who did not want the Muslims to
return.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Four nights ago</TIMEX>, base officers said, three men tried to sneak
into the base, prompting a search around the base and the shooting
off of illumination shells. Although the officers said the
intruders probably were only looking for something to steal, the
incident raised anxieties here.
<p>
   Sgt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Walker</ENAMEX> said that on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, while he was trying to
figure out who was behind the explosion, he thought of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>'s
bomb attack on the American base in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>'s
crash of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> airliner off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   As he watched the smoke rise from what he described as a very
impressive explosion, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker</ENAMEX> said he thought: ``If something like
that hits real near us, we're dead. There's no question.''
<p>
   The base is built around a large group of buildings from an
abandoned farm cooperative. The nearest civilian houses are more
than a mile away in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosnia</ENAMEX> Serb side of the dividing line. But
these too are abandoned for the most part. The owners are Muslims
who were expelled during the war, and the homes are too badly
damaged to be habitable.
<p>
   But some of the owners are repairing their homes. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, while
the American soldiers were still shaken, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamdija Mujic</ENAMEX> leaned
against the bumper of his burned car, which remains in the ruins of
the garage where it was sitting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> when an artillery
barrage destroyed his house.
<p>
   ``Yeah, we heard the explosion,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mujic</ENAMEX> said, ``but we didn't
think much of it. It was just one bomb. The Americans should
relax.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NEW YORK</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Investigators examining the small amount of wreckage
recovered so far from the crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 800
said on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that they had not yet found any concrete evidence
that the plane was destroyed by an explosive device.
<p>
   Speaking to reporters on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> said
investigators were making progress, but he added: ``We must not
draw conclusions until we're sure the conclusion is supported by
the facts. And I cannot say that I've learned anything <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> which
enables me to give you a definite conclusion about the cause of the
accident.''
<p>
   Law enforcement officials on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> continued to maintain
that circumstantial evidence suggested that the 747 jetliner
crashed because of an act of either political terrorism or
sabotage. And they said they expected to have a clearer sense of
what caused the plane to explode <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> when they
begin recovering large sections of the wreckage, possibly as early
as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Pataki</ENAMEX> said the first priority was to recover the
``dozens and dozens'' of bodies that divers had found trapped in
large sections of the fuselage resting on the bottom of the ocean.
He estimated that the divers had found 60 to 100 bodies, which
could account for most of the 122 bodies that have not been
recovered.
<p>
   Despite <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pataki</ENAMEX>'s announcement, there were conflicting statements
from other officials on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Francis</ENAMEX>, the vice-chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation
Safety Board</ENAMEX>, said there were no bodies in the wreckage that had
not been recovered.
<p>
   But despite <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX>' comments, a federal official in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East
Moriches</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
confirmed that there were dozens of bodies still on the ocean
floor.
<p>
   And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early on Wednesday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Kallstrom</ENAMEX>, assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> director
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> office, said: ``Given the fact that a portion of
the fuselage has been discovered, and that the search team has
apparently located a large debris field in the same area, we have
every hope and expectation of finding and recovering a significant
number of victims soon.''
<p>
   The accounts angered family members staying at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramada Plaza
Hotel</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy International Airport</ENAMEX>, who told reporters late on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> that they were frustrated by the conflicting
accounts.
<p>
   So far, the remains of 108 of the 230 people on board the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New
York</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> flight have been recovered, and 77 bodies have been
identified.
<p>
   At the crash site off the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Suffolk County</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long
Island</ENAMEX>, recovery workers brought up three more bodies on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>
and continued sonar mapping of the ocean floor in preparation for
the enormous task of disentangling bodies from the wreckage,
bringing them to the surface and then raising the pieces of the
airplane.
<p>
   ``Raising the remains, identifying the bodies is a top
priority,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pataki</ENAMEX> said. ``We believe there will be dozens and
dozens of bodies that will be identified and returned to their
families.''
<p>
   The governor said the second task would be to recover the large
pieces of the plane, which he said would help solve the mystery of
what made the airplane explode at an altitude of 13,700 feet
shortly after it took off for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Law enforcement officials, who from the beginning suspected that
the plane had been destroyed by an explosive device, said on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that further tests for traces of explosives from a piece of
the airplane's wing had not yet produced any evidence of such
traces. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, when law enforcement agents on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>
tested a residue found on the underside of the wing segment, they
first found traces of an explosive, but in a later test with
different equipment, no traces were detected.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesdayy</TIMEX>, when the residue was tested with more sophisticated
equipment at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> laboratory in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quantico</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, once again no
explosive traces were found on this or any other piece of wreckage
that had been retrieved.
<p>
   ``Right now,'' a senior law enforcement official said, ``we just
don't have enough pieces of metal to make a judgment about the
cause of the crash. Not today and maybe not tomorrow.''
<p>
   Even as the crash inquiry remains classified as an accident
investigation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> is investigating various criminal theories.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zachary Carter</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern District of
New York</ENAMEX>, has assigned prosecutors and investigators, led by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valerie Caproni</ENAMEX>, head of the criminal division, to monitor the
case.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kallstrom</ENAMEX>, said on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> had already conducted
1,300 interviews on the crash. ``We're looking at everybody that
touched that aircraft,'' he said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kallstrom</ENAMEX> said that two working criminal theories were that the
plane was destroyed by a bomb or a missile and that ``there's
circumstantial evidence pointing in those directions.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Bacon</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX>'s chief spokesman, cast
some doubt on the possibility of a missile. He said that satellite
photographs and radar data offered no evidence of a missile strike
on the plane. He said that apart from the accounts of eyewitnesses
who described a streak of light near the 747 before the explosion,
there was ``precious else'' to suggest that a missile had hit the
plane.
<p>
   But he told reporters that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> and other
federal agencies had left open the possibility of a missile,
possibly fired from a boat. ``Could it have been fired from the
water?'' he said. ``That is the question that they're looking
into.''

   A small single-engine plane crashed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX>
about eight miles off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX>
reported finding aircraft debris and a fuel slick, but no bodies or
survivors.
<p>
   The plane, which can carry four people, was seen hitting the
water shortly after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11 a.m.</TIMEX> by a fisherman, who radioed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast
Guard</ENAMEX>, according to Petty Officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Fenn</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for the
base at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Governors Island</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York Harbor</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midafternoon</TIMEX>, several vessels and a helicopter were combing
the area about eight miles east of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sea Bright</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, and seven
miles south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ambrose Light</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> said. The area is
55 miles from the site off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> where a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> 747 crashed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one
week earlier</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Searchers found the plane's landing gear, seat cushions and
other debris, Petty Officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fenn</ENAMEX> said. He said the water is about
125 feet deep in the crash area and that much of the wreckage had
sunk.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> said the craft had taken off from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Allaire
Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Monmouth County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation
Administration</ENAMEX> said the plane was registered to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware
Environmental Development Service</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wilmington</ENAMEX>. There was no
listing for the company in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wilmington</ENAMEX>.

<p>
   Immediately after the crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800 on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 17</TIMEX>,
speculation focused on the possibility that the plane had been
sabotaged at its previous stop before <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, the airport in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greece</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The airport has had a reputation for lax security since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>,
when terrorists hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 847 departing from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX> and
tortured and killed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Navy</ENAMEX> diver on board. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> issued a travel warning for the
airport, but lifted it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> after a new training program for
airport police began.
<p>
   Airline and airport staffs based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, along
with aviation security experts, say that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hellenikon International
Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX> has more security precautions in effect than
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy International Airport</ENAMEX>. In fact, these experts say, European
airports have gone much further toward combating the threat of
explosives on airplanes than airports in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``Our focus has been anti-hijacking, as opposed to
anti-sabotage,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billie Vincent</ENAMEX>, a former director of security
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and now a private airline security consultant. ``The
threat changed, but we did not change our focus.''
<p>
   For example, before the plane left <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX> on the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July
17</TIMEX> as Flight 881 to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, a security firm that is a subsidiary
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> searched for bombs, contraband or suspicious items in hidden
parts of the aircraft, like the panels that line the luggage
compartment and the crevices underneath the toilet or other
bathroom fixtures.
<p>
   Such a security sweep was not done when the plane landed at
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy Airport</ENAMEX> or before it took off for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>. Other airlines,
including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avianca</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Jamaica</ENAMEX>, which stop along several
known drug smuggling routes, hire private security companies to
conduct such sweeps before their planes take off from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy</ENAMEX>. Many
of the companies also monitor the people who clean the airplane
when it is on the ground, to make sure they do not plant drugs on
the aircraft. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>, which does not travel to countries that are on
prominent drug routes, does not.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takis Tassopoulos</ENAMEX>, director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aviation Security Division</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX>, said Greek police dog units inspect each flight leaving for
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Also in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX>, hand luggage is X-rayed twice, when passengers
enter the terminal and just before they get on the plane, reducing
the possibility that someone could place an explosive device in a
passenger's carry-on luggage. At <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy Airport</ENAMEX>, hand luggage is
X-rayed only upon entering the terminal, which is supposed to be
sealed off from anyone who is not a passenger or an employee.
<p>
   Air cargo is also more strictly scrutinized in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX>, said a
representative of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> air carrier there who insisted on
anonymity.
<p>
   ``We secure all our cargo,'' said the official, who said most
American carriers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greece</ENAMEX> have their own cargo X-ray machines.
``I can't tell you we X-ray everything. But there are systems in
place so everything is secured. Cargo is often manually searched.''

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NEW YORK</ENAMEX>  &MD;  When an explosion ripped through a French airliner
flying over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sahara</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, the blast severed the DC-10's front
end from the rest of the plane, which stayed aloft for about 20
seconds before plunging into the ground. The black boxes showed
that everything on board was normal until a jarring, split-second
noise was followed by silence.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two days later</TIMEX>, investigators said the crash was caused by a
bomb.
<p>
   When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> Flight 103 blew up over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>, in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1988</TIMEX>, the nose of the aircraft broke away from the rest of
the plane, scattering debris over 80 square miles of Scottish
countryside. The black boxes showed everything on board was normal,
until a split-second noise, followed by silence.
<p>
   Within three days, investigators said the probable cause was a
bomb.
<p>
   In both cases, investigators based their pronouncements that the
airplanes were destroyed by bombs not on forensic evidence found in
a laboratory, but instead on early examinations of wreckage and the
circumstances of the crashes.
<p>
   In some ways, the circumstances surrounding the explosion of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 800 on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 17</TIMEX> are strikingly similar
to the bombings of the other two. An explosion caused Flight 800's
front end to break away from the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747, which
continued to fly for about 20 seconds before becoming engulfed by a
fireball. Flight 800's black boxes show that everything on board
was normal until a split-second sound was followed by silence.
<p>
   Yet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks after Flight 800 exploded off the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long
Island</ENAMEX></TIMEX>, federal officials have not determined the cause of the
crash, or even publicly declared their strong, private suspicions
that a bomb, possibly hidden in the forward cargo hold, destroyed
the aircraft. The investigators on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> also have something
the investigators of the other two bombings did not have: dozens of
eyewitness accounts that the plane exploded in midair.
<p>
   Investigators explain their caution by saying they do not want
to leap to conclusions that might later be proved wrong. Several
officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> said that some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> officials
appeared eager to respond aggressively to the crash with
condemnations of terrorism. But, the officials said, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice
Department</ENAMEX> officials did not want to exaggerate the threat of
terrorism, and were wary of offering conclusions without clear-cut
evidence.
<p>
   In addition, some officials said, the wariness goes beyond the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> flight itself. They said federal security officials,
preoccupied by terror concerns at the Olympics, have wanted to
avoid declaring the crash a terrorist act because of fears that
such a determination would provoke domestic and foreign extremists.
<p>
   At each daily briefing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Kallstrom</ENAMEX>, the assistant director
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, says, ``The investigation is continuing,''
and he refuses to say a bomb is the most likely cause of the
explosion. Officials said they would not declare the crash to be a
result of a bomb until they had found traces of bomb materials on
wreckage from the crash.
<p>
   On both the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX> jet and the French airliner, a bomb was
hidden in a piece of luggage stored in the front cargo hold. The
force of the blast caused the front of both planes to split off in
midair.
<p>
   Because Flight 800 broke apart in a similar way, investigators
have privately speculated that the front cargo hold was the most
likely place a bomb was hidden.
<p>
   ``There are so many similarities, it's almost eerie,'' said one
federal official, who insisted on anonymity. ``It would be a major
surprise if this turned out to be some mechanical failure.''
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">In the 14 days since the crash of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> jet</TIMEX>, a powerful
dynamic has settled over the inquiry. Federal investigators refuse
to say publicly what they overwhelmingly agree on in private: a
powerful explosive destroyed the plane.
<p>
   Investigators are always reluctant to declare the official cause
of an airplane crash until there is conclusive physical evidence.
In the investigations of the downings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union de Transports Ariens</ENAMEX>
Flight 772, the one that crashed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> Flight 103,
investigators had the distinct advantage of recovering airplane
wreckage over land. Some pieces clearly showed characteristics
consistent with an explosive.
<p>
   But Flight 800 investigators have had to retrieve pieces of
potential evidence from the bottom of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX>, 120 feet
below the surface, which has made the hunt for conclusive evidence
that much more difficult.
<p>
   Those same challenges faced officials more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade ago</TIMEX>
when they investigated the crash of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air-India</ENAMEX> 747, which was
bombed off the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ireland</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1985</TIMEX>. The wreckage settled
6,700 feet below the surface of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Irish Sea</ENAMEX>, and it took more
than six months before officials declared it to be a bomb.

RECOVERY VESSELS: VARIED HISTORY AND FUNCTIONS
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times News Service</ENAMEX> clients)
By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAVID L. CHANDLER</ENAMEX>
c.<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Boston Globe</ENAMEX>

<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> ships Grasp and Grapple were built to rescue or tow
ships or submarines in distress and to salvage sunken vessels, but
their work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> on the recovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800 is not the
first time they have been used to retrieve aircraft  &MD;  or even
spacecraft.
<p>
   Less than two months after it was commissioned, the Grasp, the
older of the two vessels, was used in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> to pick up pieces of the
space shuttle Challenger from the sea floor off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The Grapple, commissioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year later</TIMEX>, was once used to recover
two F-14 jets that had crashed in 190 feet of water, although a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> spokesman declined to specify where or when this operation
took place. More conventionally, it has towed decommissioned
nuclear submarines to their final ports, it has towed three
minesweepers to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> before the Gulf War, and it helped
with harbor cleanup in the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo.
<p>
   The two ships working on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> effort off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> are the
most advanced salvage ships in the world, and they are outfitted
with the latest in equipment for surveying the sea floor,
supporting teams of divers and raising debris, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> says.
<p>
   For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> salvage, the ships' most important equipment are
Remotely Operated Vehicles, or ROVs  &MD;  small unpiloted submersibles,
connected by cables to the ship. The submirsibles carry cameras,
sonar and laser equipment, and claws to grab and retrieve objects.
They are controlled from the ship by operators who watch television
screens displaying the ROVs' sea floor view. They are capable of
diving to 7,200 feet, although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> operation is in relatively
shallow water, only 100 to 120 feet deep.
<p>
   Much of the technology they employ is relatively new. In
particular, the advent of the Global Positioning System satellites
should make it much easier for divers to locate precisely specific
targets that have been identified with the side-scan sonar used to
map the area. The system can pinpoint a location to within a few
feet.
<p>
   The robotic submersibles also carry advanced scanning systems
that use a narrow beam of laser light to locate objects on the sea
floor. A small moving mirror reflects the laser beam back and forth
across the bottom, as a light receptor builds up an image of the
debris field. The image is created one line at a time as the
submirsible is towed along, much as a computer's flatbed scanner
translates an image into digital data one line at a time.
<p>
   This is the first time the laser scanner has been used in an
actual salvage operation, said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> spokesman, Lt. j.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe
Walker</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   But even with the best of equipment, the skill of the operator
can make a big difference, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Bellingham</ENAMEX>, director of the
underwater vehicle laboratory at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Institute of
Technology</ENAMEX>. For one thing, in the murky environment of the sea
floor, it can be very difficult to get a sense of the scale of
objects located by the sonar or laser devices.
<p>
   To illustrate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bellingham</ENAMEX> cited a research project he worked on
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Winnipesaukee</ENAMEX>. A submersible found an
object the researchers thought was a coffee cup. Pulled to the
surface, it was found to be a chamber pot. ``We couldn't gauge what
the size was by looking at the video,'' he said.
<p>
   Locating pieces of the aircraft on the ocean floor is difficult
enough; recovering them is even trickier, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bellingham</ENAMEX> said. ``It's a
tough thing to do, and very much depends on surface conditions,''
he said.
<p>
   There are three basic ways to recover objects: with a ``lifting
bag,'' a canvas bag that is placed around the object and filled
with air to cause it to rise to the surface; using an ROV to grasp
the object in its claws and carry it up; or attaching cables to it
and hoisting it directly to the ship.
<p>
   The ROV is by far the gentlest and the least likely to cause
further damage to the object, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker</ENAMEX>.

<p>
   Yet, in the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> crash, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megadata</ENAMEX>'s records proved
invaluable to federal officials.
<p>
   After <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keller</ENAMEX>'s phone call, safety board investigators and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>
agents went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megadata</ENAMEX>'s office to view charts and determine what
other aircraft were in position to see the final moments of Flight
800.
<p>
   Eyewitness reports are considered by aviation experts to be
extremely unreliable, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megadata</ENAMEX> information helped establish
whether the other pilots were in positions to see what they claimed
to see.
<p>
   Based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> radar scans that emanated from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Riverhead</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megadata</ENAMEX>'s charts indicated that two aircraft  &MD;  an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> Black Hawk
helicopter and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air National Guard</ENAMEX> C-130 cargo plane  &MD;  were
indeed in position to have observed the fireball.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> radar systems of the type used in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Riverhead</ENAMEX> send out pulses
of energy that are reflected off metal objects in the sky, making
blips on a screen. The systems also send out electronic queries,
asking the identity and altitude of planes with on-board
transponders  &MD;  special radios that can respond to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> queries
by emitting electronic identification codes one one-millionth of a
second later.
<p>
   Subtracting that microsecond and dividing by the speed of light,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> knows the range, or how far away the plane is. By keeping
track of precisely where the circular-scan radar beam is pointed
when it asks the question, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> knows the direction, or bearing,
of the aircraft.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megadata</ENAMEX>'s system simply eavesdrops. The main components are a
receive-only antenna, about 5 feet high, which can be miles from
the nearest airport, and a work station to process the data.
<p>
   Although the company is searching for more customers, the reason
some buyers have been willing to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250,000</NUMEX> or so for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megadata</ENAMEX>
system can be traced to the tight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> strictures on air-to-ground
communications.
<p>
   When a plane is below 10,000 feet a ``sterile cockpit'' must be
maintained with no work or conversation not directly related to
flying the plane. That includes a ban on talk by crew members to
dispatchers at their airlines.
<p>
   For incoming flights, the radio blackout can leave airline
ground crews in the dark about precisely whether a plane will
arrive in time to let passengers make connecting flights or whether
controllers have put the plane into a low-altitude holding pattern.
<p>
   And even if radio contact were permitted, when several dozen of
an airline's planes are to land within minutes of one another,
calling them all would be too time-consuming, according to Capt.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William B. Cotton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>'s manager of air traffic and flight
systems.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> has become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megadata</ENAMEX>'s largest client, using the systems
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> and at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dulles
International</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``It's a very, very clever invention,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cotton</ENAMEX> said. With the
click of a mouse, he said, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>'s dispatchers can view all planes
aloft in the vicinity, or simply all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> planes, or focus on a
single aircraft. The system gives ground crews an estimated time of
arrival that is more accurate than pilots or dispatchers have been
able to provide, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cotton</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   If a plane is going to be late, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> uses the system to
decide, for example, whether to hold other planes on the ground to
let passengers make their connections. If its plane is in a holding
pattern above 10,000 feet, the airline can also tell its pilot how
long the wait is likely to be to help decide whether to divert to
another airport  &MD;  information that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> generally does not
provide, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cotton</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Airport managers use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megadata</ENAMEX>'s information mostly to enforce
noise-abatement ordinances.
<p>
   ``We get complaints all the time,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Wilson</ENAMEX>, a spokesman
for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco International Airport</ENAMEX>, which has used the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megadata</ENAMEX> system to resolve hundreds of complaints in the last few
years.
<p>
   ``People say: `I saw a 747 come over my house at 500 feet. I
know it was 500 feet because I could see the pilots. I could read
the numbers. I could see the wheels.' ''
<p>
   Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megadata</ENAMEX> work station, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> said airport officials
could enter the location and the time into the work station and
quickly determine the facts. ``We can tell them, it wasn't 500 feet
 &MD;  it was 3,500 feet,'' he said.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NEW YORK</ENAMEX>  &MD;  After picking apart some of the wadded remains of the
cockpit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 800, investigators concluded
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that the catastrophic explosion that destroyed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>
747 most likely did not originate inside the cockpit or in the
electronics bay beneath it.
<p>
   They were partly persuaded by a surprising discovery found in
the ton of wreckage that had been the jet's cockpit: The circles of
glass that cover many of the cockpit dials, and even a light bulb
above a staircase that led to the plane's upper deck, had somehow
survived the crash intact.
<p>
   ``You have this mass of wreckage and yet things from that area
are relatively the way they were before the accident,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert
T. Francis</ENAMEX>, vice chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety
Board</ENAMEX>. ``There is no indication at this point of anything in that
area that would give cause for concern in terms of something having
initiated there.''
<p>
   A senior investigator who looked at the cockpit wreckage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>
said that one of the plane's altimeters  &MD;  instruments that show the
plane's altitude  &MD;  was frozen with a reading of 13,100 feet.
Altimeters are mechanically driven instruments that do not depend
on electricity to work, so the finding suggests that the mechanics
continued working for several seconds after the initial explosion,
at about 13,700 feet.
<p>
   Federal investigators continued their search for the cause of
the crash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, the 20th day since Flight 800 exploded in midair
off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> and plunged into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX>, killing all
230 people on board. On the seas and on the shore, investigators
said they made a modest amount of progress, though they still have
not determined if the plane crash was caused by a bomb, a missile
attack or a mechanical malfunction.
<p>
   At the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grumman</ENAMEX> hangar in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calverton</ENAMEX>, investigators on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> began piecing together the fractured parts of the airplane.
They also pulled about one-third of the cockpit wreckage off the
one-ton ball of metal, essentially unwrapping it.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James K. Kallstrom</ENAMEX>, the assistant director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>
office, said he had sent many agents who had been working in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Suffolk County</ENAMEX> back to their home offices, mostly in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX>.
Criminal investigators are anxious for the cause to be determined,
he said, adding: ``We are in a bit of a waiting pattern.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SMITHTOWN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Investigators said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> that they have
given up hope of finding the remaining 35 victims from the wreckage
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the three weeks since the crash</TIMEX>, divers have brought up 195
of the 230 passengers and crew who were aboard the jumbo jet on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 17</TIMEX>. But as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> salvage ships continue to bring up large
pieces of wreckage from the plane, it is becoming less likely that
many more bodies remain hidden.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Francis</ENAMEX>, vice chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation
Safety Board</ENAMEX>, said finding victims remains the top priority. But
``there's just not the kind of wreckage out there anymore where
we'd expect to find bodies,'' he said.
<p>
   He said that families have been told and that they are ``pretty
understanding.''
<p>
   In another development, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> is
expected to announce <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tjirdau</TIMEX> that it will requiring testing of fuel
pumps on 747s for electrical resistance.
<p>
   There are 14 pumps on the jumbo jet's wings, and low resistance
indicates they could develop arcing that might lead to a fuel leak
and a possible fire. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1995</TIMEX>, a fire related to a fuel pump
leak broke out in the wheelwell of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan Airlines</ENAMEX> plane. It was
extinguished before the plane took off.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> jet experienced a power loss and its cockpit-voice and
flight data recorders ended abruptly, which investigators say would
not have happened in the case of an engine failure or explosion.
<p>
   In the past few days, as fewer and fewer victims have been
found, investigators have shifted their attention to recovering
pieces of the plane that could be crucial to solving the mystery of
what caused the 747 to explode in midair on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 17</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The salvage ship USS Grasp pulled up a 75-foot-long section of
the plane's right wing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, with a chunk of the fuselage
attached to it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said he saw burn marks on the wing, but he
warned against drawing conclusions from that, noting that the
ocean's surface was on fire when the plane crashed and the wing
could have been burned when it hit the water.
<p>
   Technicians onboard the Grasp were working on cutting the wing
in two, so that it would fit onto the tugboat bringing pieces of
the wreckage back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grumman</ENAMEX> aircraft hangar on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>,
where they are being analyzed.
<p>
   Investigators are also now interested in bringing up the plane's
engines as quickily as possible. Two of the four engines  &MD;  and a
piece of the third  &MD;  have been found by sonar detectors.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said the engines are key evidence, mainly because they
might show where the explosion came from  &MD;  a missile from outside
the plane or a bomb from within, and, if the latter, where in the
plane.
<p>
   He said a ``rub strip'' is inside the engine, surrounding its
fan blades. When the blades rotate, the strip keeps them from
damaging the engine's shell.
<p>
   ``In an accident, you can sometimes tell from the rub strip what
kind of forces have come to bear on the aircraft,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said.
``You can end up with the fan clipping part of the rub strip. An
engineer can figure out where that force came from.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Kallstrom</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> assistant director involved in the
investigation, said, ``We're very pleased with the speed of the
recovery of parts of the aircraft.''
<p>
   When asked if it might be a few weeks or more before they figure
out what caused the explosion, he replied: ``It could very well be.
I would hope it won't be that long ... Whether it's a week or two
weeks or four days, I don't know.''

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  A military plane carrying a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> agent
and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> crew of eight crashed into a mountain minutes
after taking off from President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyoming</ENAMEX> retreat <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late
Saturday night</TIMEX>, killing everyone on board, officials said.
<p>
   The C-130 aircraft was carrying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> agent and an
automobile used by security officers in presidential motorcades. It
was bound from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jackson Hole</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyo.</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> spent his holiday,
to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX>, where he was to attend a 50th birthday party
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The plane took off from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jackson Hole</ENAMEX> airport at about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:45
p.m. Saturday night</TIMEX>, according to state and local officials in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyoming</ENAMEX> and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> spokesman in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, where the crew of the
plane was based.
<p>
   About <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three minutes later</TIMEX>, after flying about 15 miles southeast
and reaching an altitude of about 10,000 feet, the C-130 slammed
into the side of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sheep Mountain</ENAMEX>, known locally as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sleeping Indian</ENAMEX>.
It exploded in a fireball visible in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Teton Village</ENAMEX>, a resort town
20 miles away. The crash site was about 1,000 feet below the
11,300-foot summit.
<p>
   A party of 28 searchers set out for the remote site on foot and
on horseback a few hours later. But the impact of the explosion,
with the plane hitting the mountain above the timberline at 200
miles an hour or more with about 18 tons of fuel on board, was so
severe that they found little more than smouldering fragments.
<p>
   The C-130 has generally been considered an unusually safe
aircraft  &MD;  a slow, fat, reliable workhorse, nicknamed the Hercules,
and is used mostly to haul people and equipment around the world.
But this crash was the third fatal one involving a C-130 in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past 15 months</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Four weeks ago</TIMEX>, a C-130 flown by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belgian Air Force</ENAMEX> crashed
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netherlands</ENAMEX>, killing 32 people, most of them members of a
Dutch military orchestra. And in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1995</TIMEX>, a C-130 carrying six <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air
Force</ENAMEX> reservists went down in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Idaho</ENAMEX> after an engine caught
fire, killing all aboard.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>'s crash was also the third time in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past 16
months</TIMEX> that an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> plane has carried <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government
officials to their death.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1995</TIMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> C-21, a military version of a
Learjet executive aircraft, crashed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alabama</ENAMEX> and killed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark G.
Fiester</ENAMEX>, an assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> secretary. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A year later</TIMEX>, two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air
Force</ENAMEX> pilots trying to land their military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737 at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Croatia</ENAMEX>, flew straight into the highest peak for miles around,
killing all 35 people aboard, including Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald H. Brown</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   A study of military aircraft mishaps published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months ago</TIMEX> by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>, the investigative arm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>,
found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73 percent</NUMEX> of the most severe accidents <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">in 1994 and 1995</TIMEX>
were caused by human error, mistakes by pilots or, more rarely,
ground crews or air traffic controllers.
<p>
   At the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">White House</ENAMEX>, shortly before departing for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> said the deaths of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> agent and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air
Force</ENAMEX> crew members were ``especially painful to us because they
worked for me and did an invaluable service, and I am very sad
about it.'' The president and his family had left <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyoming</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> a few hours before the crash on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>.

<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan Airport</ENAMEX> expects by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">end of next week</TIMEX> to have
two explosives-detection units ready to roll out at a moment's
notice to sniff out dangerous objects in luggage and cargo
compartments, or even at check-in gates.
<p>
   Each weighing about 45 pounds, the units are made by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>-area
companies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ion Track Instruments Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wilmington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermedics
Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Woburn</ENAMEX>. Airport security director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Lawless</ENAMEX> said that
along with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan</ENAMEX>'s five trained bomb-sniffing dogs, the units will
provide another level of assurance for a flying public deeply
worried about in-flight safety.
<p>
   Three out of four corporate travel managers polled by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Business Travel Association</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>, after the crash of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800, said they would be willing to pay a premium on
airline tickets to improve airport security.
<p>
   Respondents to the poll also chided the government and airlines
for failing to take security seriously enough. Many of those who
opposed paying more said they were concerned that government would
only waste the money.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawless</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan</ENAMEX> is still working out whether to lease or buy
the explosives-detection devices. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ion Track</ENAMEX>'s version lists for
more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50,000</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermedics</ENAMEX>' for over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$150,000</NUMEX>. The two
designs also function differently, he said, but having both will
provide a testing ground for their effectiveness.
<p>
   Other security procedures put into force after Flight 800 went
down already are complicating the lives of passengers who book
trips ``electronically,'' without traditional tickets.
<p>
   Electronic ticketing eliminates paperwork and boosts airline
profit margins. Passengers get a confirmation number when they
reserve their flights. At the gate, they get a boarding pass by
repeating their number and showing a photo identification card.
<p>
   The system didn't work, though, when airports, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan</ENAMEX>,
tightened up who can get to the gates. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawless</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan</ENAMEX> took this
step because its higher number of overseas travelers could make the
airport more vulnerable to terrorism.
<p>
   Now, airlines that don't issue paper tickets must send agents to
meet their passengers at the metal detectors. With passenger lists
in hand, they check in each person individually.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JetTrain</ENAMEX>, the start-up low-fare airline that was going to fly
from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newark</ENAMEX> beginning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>, has shifted gears and
now will fly a triangular route between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>, starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-September</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JetTrain</ENAMEX> has been flying
from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past year</TIMEX>. Airline
spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carmine Cardillo</ENAMEX> said the latest change is aimed at
filling the void left when two other low-cost carriers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nation's Air</ENAMEX>, ended <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> service.

service, three days a week via <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> with a stop to refuel in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Anchorage</ENAMEX>. The first plane lands at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9 p.m.</TIMEX> A ceremonial
ribbon-cutting is scheduled at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> gates at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Korean Air</ENAMEX> says this is the first same-plane service ever from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massport</ENAMEX> says it's going to hold a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX>
Lobster Festival in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seoul</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> to promote this region as a
tourist and business destination.

   About those antlers you might want to bring home as a trophy

unusual baggage since details, compiled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Best Fares</ENAMEX> magazine, ran
in this column. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> has lifted its ban on antlers and now accepts
them at the discretion of airport agents. Also, skis, golf clubs
and fishing gear are now checked without charge versus the fees of
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$45</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$75</NUMEX> that were previously posted. Surfboards still cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50</NUMEX>
extra, as do bicycles, pet kennels and scuba gear.
<p>
   But, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Best Fares</ENAMEX> researcher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elaine Hewlett</ENAMEX>, cyclists
can ship their wheels free now on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX>  &MD;  although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> has authorized its pilots to disconnect the seat-back phone

<p>
   The crash of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> C-130 carrying equipment for use by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> is fair if gruesome warning that some day an American
president may be killed in an air crash.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> family had departed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jackson Hole</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyo.</ENAMEX>, in another
plane only hours before the C-130 slammed into a mountainside
shortly after takeoff. All nine persons aboard, including a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret
Service</ENAMEX> agent, were killed.
<p>
   The death of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Brown</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> in a somewhat
similar plane crash in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Croatia</ENAMEX> offered the same warning.
<p>
   The destruction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800 off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX>,
perhaps by a bomb or even a missile, adds the chilling possibility
of terrorist assault.
<p>
   All these incidents, plus others  &MD;  three fatal C-130 crashes
have occurred <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">in 15 months</TIMEX>  &MD;  should suggest at least two common
sense developments.
<p>
    &MD;  1) As do many husbands and wives and some top business
executives, presidents and vice presidents should follow the
practice of never flying together. Candidates for those offices
should take the same precaution, even if it hinders their ability
to campaign together.
<p>
    &MD;  2) The historic custom of presidential nominees choosing their
vice presidential running mates without regard to their experience
or ability to take over the presidency, if necessary, must no
longer be accepted.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX>, the recent Republican president nominee, appears to
have pondered his choice carefully and named a qualified man in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX>, the former congressman and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabinet</ENAMEX> member. So did
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, when he chose Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>.
<p>
   As recently as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> made an apparently
quixotic choice in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Danforth Quayle</ENAMEX> In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1952</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX> was
chosen by Republican leaders  &MD;  not by the nominee, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dwight
Eisenhower</ENAMEX>  &MD;  less for his presidential qualifications than for his
anti-Communist fame and acceptability to the party's ``old guard.''
<p>
   A constitutional amendment is not necessary to improve the
chances that a qualified vice presidential nominee will be chosen.
And, anyway, such an amendment probably would be hard to write and
impossible to enforce. What is really needed is for American voters
to turn their backs on a presidential nominee who makes a blatantly
political or otherwise unsuitable choice for vice president.
<p>
   Or perhaps presidential nominees should run alone and, if
elected, use provisions of the 22nd Amendment to nominate someone
for vice president.
<p>
   That person then would have to undergo extensive congressional
investigation and confirmation  &MD;  as did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Rockefeller</ENAMEX>, when he
was nominated for vice president by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Ford</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ford</ENAMEX> had
been chosen by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> when the sitting vice president,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spiro T. Agnew</ENAMEX>, had been forced to resign.
<p>
   Proponents of air travel will protest, no doubt accurately, that
it is safer than any form of ground transportation. That
statistical argument overlooks the fact that an air crash is far
more likely to be fatal to all involved than are other forms of
accident.
<p>
   And presidents now travel almost exclusively by air  &MD;  including
helicopters for short hauls.
<p>
   It will be argued, too, that no aircraft could be more carefully
maintained or skillfully operated than those used by a president.
Thousands of commercial passengers can testify to being held up in
scheduled takeoffs or landings because right-of-way was being
cleared for Air Force One.
<p>
   If safe air travel can be guaranteed, it certainly is for the
occupant of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Still, no amount of precaution or skill can preclude the
unexpected or predict the unpredictable. And if terrorism is a
threat, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> 800 investigators may conclude, what juicier target
could there be than a plane carrying a president and his entourage?
<p>
   When I was The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> correspondent during
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> administration, a small group of us termed ourselves
``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> regulars''  &MD;  meaning we went on every presidential
trip, no matter how insignificant or unlikely to produce news. We
did so to keep a ``death watch'' on the president  &MD;  though none of
us really believed, until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 22, 1963</TIMEX>, that it was necessary.
<p>
   President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>, of course, was murdered on the ground. That
does not alter the rising odds that some day or some night,
somewhere in an unaccountable world, sometime in the uncharted
future, a high-flying president will be brought to earth by chance,
or by malevolent design.

NEW YORK: the machine.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The Egis machine sniffs vapors of invisible particles. It can
detect C4, a plastic explosive made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> military, Semtex,
an explosive manufactured in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>, and Detasheet, a
plastic compound that comes in quarter-inch thick sheets and that
contains PETN.
<p>
   A 10-pound vacuum sniffs a sample of air, which is then
transferred to a 4-feet-by-2-feet metal box. The machine's computer
spits out a chemical profile.
<p>
   Certain federal agents, calling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s laboratory in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> a ``black hole,'' remained convinced that the bureau was
hiding its positive lab confirmations.
<p>
   ``There was one problem after another with this investigation,
from weather to lab results,'' a federal investigator said.
``People became incredibly frustrated. Then, with information
sacred and everybody wishing for the smoking gun, people got
paranoid. It was like separate cells were formed. Certain people
would only speak with certain other people.''
<p>
   While secrets were preserved, there were relaxations of the
wariness. For instance, two federal agents, after staring at a
fragment of aircraft, asked a safety board expert nearby for help.
He, in turn, had to consult with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> engineer. In a moment,
the manufacturer's representative identified the part.
<p>
   But some investigators began to suspect that with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of
dollars</NUMEX> at stake, industry representatives were reading into the
wreckage what they wanted to see.
<p>
   One industry expert was sure he had seen ``shock waves'' in the
fuselage, a clear indication of a bomb. Law enforcement authorities
said it was unclear what the damage was, and what meaning it held.
<p>
   And according to a federal official, the people representing the
engine's manufacturer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pratt &AMP; Whitney</ENAMEX>, did not hide their relief
when the four engines had been brought to shore, opened and
declared a non-factor.
<p>
   ``There are camps, divided camps,'' one investigator said.
<p>
   The competing conclusions only fueled the news coverage of the
investigation, and thus the public's sense of what was true, what
was coming.
<p>
   ``The most frustrating thing is all the people that are talking
to the news media, giving different versions and having different
agendas,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kallstrom</ENAMEX> said. Later, he added, ``I have a problem with
anyone rooting for anything. And if they are rooting for anything
that's unique to their sphere of influence or their domain, they're
part of the problem, not part of the solution.''
<p>
   There was no solution to the disabling sadness. Investigators,
wearing surgical masks against the odors, created cardboard boxes
for each victim. Into each went every piece of personal belonging
that could be linked to an individual  &MD;  wedding rings, wallets, a
coloring book.
<p>
   Then there were the personal belongings and the clothing that
did not have obvious owners  &MD;  ``orphaned'' bits, the agents called
them.
<p>
   ``You just have to find a way to keep sorting through it all,''
said an investigator who had worked on a handful of airline bombing
investigations.
<p>
   ``Pick through the debris, run your eyes and hands over what
appears interesting, test it, test it again. You wait for that
jewel. Of course, it's a sick jewel, in a way.''
<p>
   THE PROCESS: An Epic Exercise Of Elimination
<p>
   Despite the initial chaos and the ensuing divisions of opinion
and operational style, a unifying thread came to course through the
investigation. The thread was frustration.
<p>
   The investigation, after all, had become one large, detailed map
of dead ends. Results from the forensics lab were inconclusive.
Theories of structural malfunction, from probability's outer
fringes, were undone by hard data. The ocean stubbornly refused to
give up solid leads.
<p>
   The entire investigation, then, became an epic exercise in
elimination. Knocking down theories  &MD;  in their entirety or in their
speculative detail  &MD;  became the most satisfying work.
<p>
   The momentum for erasing a mechanical failure as the cause of
the crash gathered early and never really relented.
<p>
   The aircraft had recently been through some of the most rigorous
examinations the industry requires. The black boxes revealed only
sudden silence after a split-second sound spoke volumes to
investigators, downgrading malfunction's standing as a theory.
<p>
   Within days of their discovery, a second major site of debris,
the front of the plane, was located. The inference was inescapable:
The plane had split  &MD;  just as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> 103 had over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   A third debris field sprinkled with luggage and tiny scraps of
metal underscored the suspicion for everyone that the malfunction
theory was fantasy.
<p>
   The engines proved fine four weeks into the inquiry; the fuel
tank, the last, best hope for theorists of mechanical failure, did
not appear to have exploded as the initiating incident.
<p>
   The safety investigators privately conceded they had no known
way of explaining through mechanical failure what had occurred.
Even the mantra of their methodology  &MD;  the history of aviation
accidents is a history of things that never happened before  &MD;  was
recited without enthusiasm.
<p>
   The belief that a bomb destroyed the airplane was always
strongest. But even it suffered under the waves of negation: The
cockpit, briefly thought to be the location of the explosion, was
found mangled, but with parts of it, such as glass instrument
dials, tellingly intact. It was thus ruled out as the site of the
blast.
<p>
   Four weeks into the investigation, the front cargo bins, the
location of choice for numerous previous bombers, came up empty of
evidence. The bomb experts, not budging from their instinctive
conclusion that a bomb had done the damage, said, in the words of
one agent, ``No one could have imagined that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 percent</NUMEX> of the
plane would be up and at least some absolute proof of a bomb not
have been found.''
<p>
   The longshot theories, then, survived.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kallstrom</ENAMEX>, the central processor of all theories (including the
absurd E-mail tips of extra-terrestrials), had a particular
fascination with the idea that a missile had struck the aircraft.
<p>
   ``I gave up being surprised at anything a long time ago,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kallstrom</ENAMEX> said early on.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NEW YORK</ENAMEX>  &MD;  In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>, a few weeks before the crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World
Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 800 off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>, leaders of several Middle
Eastern terrorist organizations backed by the Iranian government
met in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Teheran</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>, to plan terrorist acts, intelligence
officials said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Among them was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command</ENAMEX>, an organization that has been linked to
airplane bombings in the past, according to the officials. And its
leader, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed Jabril</ENAMEX>, came to the meeting to ask for permission to
carry out terrorist attacks against American interests, one
intelligence official said.
<p>
   The organizations that attended the meeting, and the session
itself, are among a number of avenues that federal investigators
are following in their inquiry into the crash of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> jet,
according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
<p>
   Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> has not declared that the plane crashed as the
result of a criminal act, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> crime lab has found traces of
PETN, a component of plastic explosives, on a piece of wreckage
from the cabin of the plane. Investigators noted that PETN was a
component of bombs used in past terrorist bombings of airplanes.
<p>
   The intelligence officials cautioned that they had no evidence
linking the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Teheran</ENAMEX> to the crash on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 17</TIMEX>. They
note that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX> is not known to have targeted Americans in recent
years and that the time span between the meeting and the crash may
have been too short to execute a complex operation.
<p>
   But a senior federal investigator working on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> case said
investigators were interested in learning more about the meeting.
At the same time, though, investigators say they are examining many
other individuals and organizations in their inquiry.
<p>
   If Flight 800 is proved to have been brought down by a bomb, as
most investigators strongly believe, it remains possible that no
foreign terrorists were involved. The crash could have been the
result of a domestic criminal act. Still, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> crash is
eventually blamed on a terrorist attack, the investigators said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jabril</ENAMEX> and the others who were in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Teheran</ENAMEX> would be high on a short
list of suspects.
<p>
   Other terrorist groups identified as present at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Teheran</ENAMEX>
meeting included leaders of the Lebanese-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX>, which has
been linked to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX> bomb blast in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beirut</ENAMEX> that killed 241 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
Marines, and the Egyptian branch of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic Jihad</ENAMEX>, which is loyal
to Sheik <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar Abdel Rahman</ENAMEX>. He was convicted of plotting to blow up
the United Nations, and his followers were convicted of the bomb
attack on the World Trade Center.
<p>
   In recent years, a small number of terrorist organizations have
demonstrated the capability of bombing an airplane. While
investigators have not ruled out the possibility of a previously
unknown group, investigators say evidence amassed about the bombs
and methods used in previous attacks may yield important clues in
the investigation of Flight 800.
<p>
   ``If it was a bomb, determining the kind of bomb and the way it
got on the plane will narrow down the universe of suspects,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Cannistraro</ENAMEX>, a private security consultant and former chief
of counterterrorism at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX>.

<p>
   To some experts in terrorism and airline security, the notion
that a missile had blown the aircraft out of the sky was
far-fetched, and several expressed amazement at the ``shelf life of
the missile theory.'' The plane was out of range, they said.
<p>
   But others, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kallstrom</ENAMEX> included, had a resilient fealty to the
rocket theory. He and others could not ignore the dozens of
eyewitness accounts testifying to a streaking light intersecting
with the aircraft. The details matched in many ways.
<p>
   In addition, the notion that Stinger missiles from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>
might have made their way into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> was a longstanding
assumption within law enforcement circles.
<p>
   The presence on the crash scene of officials with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National
Security Agency</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> reinforced in
some minds that there might have been some intercepted intelligence
regarding a missile attack.
<p>
   And so the viability of the missile theory  &MD;  which seemed to
carry a dread greater than a bomb  &MD;  rose and sank daily, in the
minds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kallstrom</ENAMEX> and other investigators. Yet, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kallstrom</ENAMEX>, early
on, refused to acknowledge publicly how seriously investigators had
taken the possibility of a missile attack.
<p>
   ``I don't want to scare people,'' he said in front of his
agents.
<p>
   Investigators ran down reports of stolen boats on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>,
and senior investigators three days into the investigation broke
down the likelihood of the three causes this way: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 percent</NUMEX>
missile, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 percent</NUMEX> bomb, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> malfunction.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kallstrom</ENAMEX> ordered his agents to research the Mistral, a
French-made missile that could be launched from a tripod and that
would have had the range capability. Other experts offered the
possibility that a small-engine Cessna might have been equipped to
fire a Sidewinder missile.
<p>
   The missile theory did not go away. Agents spent chunks of their
days rereading the eyewitness interviews. A kind of missile cult
emerged within the ranks of the agents. The group was never more
enthusiastic than when one of the first preliminary positive
results registered at the hangar in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calverton</ENAMEX> showed evidence of
PETN, a component found in some missiles.
<p>
   Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX>, asked to provide
investigators with a full accounting of military activity that
might have been going on in the area of the crash, launched such a
diligent inquiry that it took days to come up with complete
information, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kallstrom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> officials.
<p>
   Public records showed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> had issued a warning to
mariners that it might be conducting ``firing tests'' in a section
of the sea roughly 80 nautical miles northeast of the crash scene.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> also had an aircraft near the crash site. It briefly
helped recover information.
<p>
   By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late July</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kallstrom</ENAMEX> had doubts about the missile theory, but
he never completely let go. And despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>'s assurances,
he refused to rule out a ``friendly fire'' mishap, saying only that
``it's not in the crosshairs of my radar.''
<p>
   Then, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks ago</TIMEX>, came the most dramatic moment, which took
place in a cramped third-floor laboratory in the J. Edgar Hoover
Building in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>. The endless frustration was snapped. The
string of inconclusive results had ended: A positive finding for
the explosives was confirmed with the most sophisticated detection
machinery in the world.
<p>
   The revelation of the finding  &MD;  which investigators insist does
not rule out a missile  &MD;  sharpened the details of the remaining
hunt: find the blast site, and with it the metal wreckage that
could be brought before the cameras.
<p>
   Study the ``sick jewel'' for its signatures that could produce
suspects: what contained the bomb, the exact type of explosive
used, any available fragment of the detonating device. Microscopic
clues had produced breakthroughs for investigators in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX>
103 bombing, a tiny sliver of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX> stereo sending agents to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``It doesn't get us all the way where we need to be,'' a senior
investigator said of the lab finding.
<p>
   But if the mystery had not been completely solved, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> and
others believed something strongly. A wonder had been worked.
<p>
   Yes, it might take a full dredging of the ocean floor before the
right hunk of plane was recovered. Yes, things could have gone more
smoothly. Yes, the safety board investigators would spend the
coming months examining everything and one day recommending a range
of thoughts on industry policies on aircraft construction, perhaps
even on how the safety board and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> might conduct a similar,
subsequent investigation.
<p>
   ``What an incredible feat is being accomplished,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said
of the entire effort. ``People say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Cousteau</ENAMEX> does this all
the time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Cousteau</ENAMEX> makes it look easy. Well, he's working
off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bimini</ENAMEX> where you can see 94 miles through the water, and he's
picking up shellfish, not jagged pieces of aluminum.''
<p>
   ``There is no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX> of air safety investigation,'' he said.

HIJACKED SUDANESE AIRLINER LANDS IN <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">BRITAIN</ENAMEX>

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">STANSTED</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Police negotiated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> with several
hijackers believed to be Iraqis who seized a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sudan Airways</ENAMEX> plane
with 199 people aboard and demanded that it be flown to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   After nearly five hours of negotiations, 160 passengers, most of
them women and children, were allowed to leave the plane. But the
other 26 passengers along with 13 crew remained on board along with
``six or seven'' hijackers claiming to be carrying grenades and
explosives, police said.
<p>
   Police said the hijackers were accompanied by their families and
had asked to see a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iraqi Community Association</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, an organization that helps Iraqis seeking aslyum.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Essex County</ENAMEX> police said the passengers were mostly Sudanese,
but included Syrians, Saudis, Jordanians and Palestinians. None of
the released passengers were mistreated, although three were sick
and had been taken to a hospital, police said. Their illnesses were
unrelated to the ordeal.
<p>
   Police were questioning the released hostages at a nearby
terminal as negotations with the hijackers, conducted by radio,
continued.
<p>
   ``Everyone seems calm and collected. My understanding is that no
one has been hurt,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Essex</ENAMEX> police spokeswoman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim White</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sudan Airways</ENAMEX> Flight 150 was hijacked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> about 25
minutes after it left the Sudanese capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Khartoum</ENAMEX> heading for
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jordan</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airbus</ENAMEX> 310 jetliner landed at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Larnaca International Airport</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cyprus</ENAMEX> to refuel before being forced on to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cyprus</ENAMEX>
aviation officials quoted one hijacker as saying he wanted
political asylum in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The plane arrived at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stansted</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s third airport 30 miles
to the northeast, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4:30 a.m.</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11:30 p.m., Eastern time</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>). Armed and masked <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Essex</ENAMEX> police officers surrounded the
aircraft as it stood in an isolated spot on the tarmac two miles
from the terminal.
<p>
   In hijack situations, British authorities usually direct planes
to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stansted</ENAMEX>, which is especially prepared for such events and is
located in a rural area, rather than to the busier <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Heathrow</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gatwick</ENAMEX> airports.
<p>
   It has been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 years since a hijacked airplane has landed in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX></TIMEX>.
<p>
   About a dozen police, fire and rescue vehicles were arrayed far
from the plane in case of an accident or if the negotiations turned
sour.
<p>
   Police said the hijackers were releasing the passengers in
groups of 10 or so at a time and that they hoped more would be
freed.
<p>
   It was the second hijacking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> involving a Sudanese
airliner.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 24</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sudan Airways</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airbus</ENAMEX> A320 plane carrying 40
passengers and crew on an internal flight was hijacked to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asmara</ENAMEX>,
the Eritrean capital, where the two Sudanese hijackers surrendered
and sought political asylum.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OSLO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norway</ENAMEX>  &MD;  A Russian jetliner carrying more than 140 people
 &MD;  mostly coal miners and their families  &MD;  crashed into a mountain
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> on the remote <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic</ENAMEX> island of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spitsbergen</ENAMEX> in Norwegian
territory. There appeared to be no survivors, Norwegian authorities
said.
<p>
   The three-engine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tupolev</ENAMEX> Tu-154 owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vnukovo Airlines</ENAMEX> was
nearing the end of a flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> when it went off course
amid low clouds and struck <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Opera Mountain</ENAMEX>, a 3,000-foot peak six
miles east of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Svalbard Airport</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Longyearbyen</ENAMEX>, the island's main
settlement.
<p>
   The passengers were described as Russians and Ukrainians, most
of them workers for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trust Arktik Ugol</ENAMEX> mining company. They were
a relief force for an equal number of miners and family members who
had been waiting at the airport to take the same jet back to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>'s ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yuri Fokine</ENAMEX>, said that up to 20
children were aboard the jet, but Norwegian authorities in touch
with the airline maintained that the passenger list comprised 125
adults and 4 children, in addition to either 12 or 14 crew members.
<p>
   Flight controllers reported losing radio contact with the jet at
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:15 a.m.</TIMEX> At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:06 p.m.</TIMEX> a Norwegian search party in two
helicopters and a light plane found most of the wreckage on a snowy
plateau, officials said. The rear section of the jet had tumbled
down a cliff, causing a small avalanche.
<p>
   Five rescue workers who landed at the scene determined that
there were no survivors, then left <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three and a half hours later</TIMEX>
because of thickening fog, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norway</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rescue Coordination Center</ENAMEX>
said. It said the temperature was in the high 30s.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fokine</ENAMEX> praised the rescue effort in an interview with Norwegian
television and added, ``There was no sign of life when the
helicopters arrived.''
<p>
   A Norwegian minister, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan Hoifoedt</ENAMEX>, informed the group waiting
at the airport of the crash.
<p>
   ``The tears flowed,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoifoedt</ENAMEX> told a radio interviewer. ``Many
had friends, work acquaintances and even some family members
aboard. It is a huge tragedy for so small a community.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spitsbergen</ENAMEX> is the largest island in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Svalbard</ENAMEX> archipelago,
about 350 miles north of the Norwegian mainland. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1920</TIMEX> treaty gave
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norway</ENAMEX> ownership of the archipelago, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> acquired
mining rights in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1935</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Svalbard</ENAMEX>'s population of 2,500, almost two-thirds are
citizens of former Soviet republics. They operate two mines  &MD;  in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pyramiden</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Barentsburg</ENAMEX>  &MD;  extracting some 600,000 tons of coal a
year, about twice the output of Norwegian mines.
<p>
   Investigators from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oslo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> are not expected to reach the
crash site until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, when removal of the bodies is to
begin. The Norwegian government was also sending criminal
investigators, though officials said there was no immediate sign of
foul play.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Early this evening</TIMEX> a Norwegian helicopter crew managed to lift
two prefabricated cabins onto the plateau near the wreckage. From
there, two or three sentries were to make sure the site is not
disturbed during the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``There are about 2,000 polar bears on this island,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rune
B. Hansen</ENAMEX>, the acting governor. ``We haven't seen any around here
lately but they are unpredictable and can suddenly be anywhere.''
<p>
   Though the number of air fatalities in the former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>
has declined in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last two years</TIMEX>, it remains alarmingly high
compared to what it was during the Soviet era.
<p>
   When the Soviet airline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> was broken up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</TIMEX>,
many new air companies were created. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vnukovo Airlines</ENAMEX> is one of
dozens of these so-called ``babyflots,'' which have been plagued by
lack of cash and poor maintenance. Many if not most of the aircraft
in the Russian fleets are long past retirement age.
<p>
   An official at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vnukova Airlines</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> refused to comment
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> on the crash.

Airlines</ENAMEX>, grounded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">for more than two months after a deadly crash in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX></TIMEX>, could start flying again under greater agency
scrutiny.
<p>
   The approval, one of two hurdles the airlines must clear before
resuming service, comes 10 weeks after the agency ordered a halt to
its operations because of systemic safety problems uncovered after
the crash on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11</TIMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> DC-9 that killed all 110 people
aboard.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> also received tentative approval <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> to resume
flights from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Transportation</ENAMEX>, which evaluates the
competence and safety record of an airline's managers as well as
the carrier's economic health.
<p>
   With the department's decision, a seven-day comment period
begins during which the agency will receive any objections to
letting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> resume service.
<p>
   It will review the objections, give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> a chance to respond
and then make its final determination. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> clears this
second hurdle with no objections, it could be back in the air as
soon as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next Thursday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Transportation officials, however, are likely to hear again
about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association of Flight Attendants</ENAMEX>, a union
representing flight attendants at the airline.
<p>
   The union has repeatedly complained to the transportation
department in recent weeks that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s senior officers are not
fit to run a safe airline in large measure because of the lapses
found at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The department said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that it had taken into account the
union's recent objections in making its tentative decision. A
lawyer representing the union, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert S. Clayman</ENAMEX>, said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>
that the union planned to file more complaints.
<p>
   ``What the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOT</ENAMEX> has suggested <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is that the men in charge of
the airline were in no way responsible for all of the safety
violations that caused their shutdown,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clayman</ENAMEX> said in an
interview. ``We thought it was one strike and you're out, not trial
and error.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John V. Coleman</ENAMEX>, director of aviation analysis at the
department, said in a conference call with reporters that the two
top officers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Priddy</ENAMEX>, chairman, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis H.
Jordan</ENAMEX>, president  &MD;  had good safety records over their long airline
careers. ``Nothing in their background suggests that they have been
noncompliant with federal regulations of any kind,'' he said.
<p>
   The aviation agency said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> had been approved
to resume service with nine aircraft, and could quickly add up to
six more. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> had 51 aircraft in its fleet when the airline was
shut down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 17</TIMEX>. The safety lapses that led to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s
grounding were not directly linked to the cause of the crash.
<p>
   Since the grounding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>, the airline had met the agency's
requirements for resuming service, including revising its
maintenance program and procedures, revising its organizational
structure and adding new maintenance and management personnel, and
retraining pilots and maintenance workers, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>.
The airline also will initially fly only one type of DC-9.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> also said it would raise the number of inspectors
assigned to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> to seven from three, and closely scrutinize its
plans to expand once it resumes flying.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> executives said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that they hoped to resume
service to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> and four as yet unnamed cities in about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two
weeks</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> appears to have changed its approach to speaking
publicly about the safety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>. Immediately after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11</TIMEX>
crash, top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOT</ENAMEX> officials declared <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> a safe airline.
<p>
   When asked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> now considered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> safe,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill White</ENAMEX>, deputy director of flight standards at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>,
responded only by saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> was in compliance with safety
regulations.
<p>
   ``It's up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> to maintain the safe operation of the
aircraft,'' he said.

OVERSIGHT FAULTED IN POLICE HELICOPTER CRASH REPORT

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">BOSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  &UR;  &LR; Top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Police</ENAMEX> officials were warned of management
problems within the air wing even before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1995</TIMEX>
helicopter crash that killed two troopers and two civilians,
according to a report issued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The final administrative report of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Police</ENAMEX> on the crash
repeats the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1995</TIMEX> findings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation
Safety Board</ENAMEX> on the two contributing causes of the crash  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State
Police</ENAMEX> management's failure to provide adequate oversight of the
air wing, and fuel contamination from an poorly maintained facility
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Framingham</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   But the report adds explicitly that a third cause of the
aircraft's crash into a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Memorial Drive</ENAMEX> boathouse in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambridge</ENAMEX> was
``failure of the pilot to execute a proper autorotation,'' a safety
procedure designed to allow an emergency landing after engine
failure.
<p>
   The crash of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Eurocopter</ENAMEX> ASTAR craft killed two
state police troopers and pilots, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Mattaliano</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Perry</ENAMEX>,
and two civilian employees of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&AMP;T</ENAMEX> who were also aboard, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur
Howell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael McCarthy</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>'s report chronicled two instances in which warnings were
sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Police</ENAMEX> management pointing to problems in its
aviation wing.
<p>
   In one case, a civilian manager at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norwood Airport</ENAMEX> reported
observing ``a lack of training activity'' among the police unit and
reported complaints about ``training practices and
professionalism'' within the air wing.
<p>
   That manager, who is unnamed but is employed by a company that
is a defendant in a lawsuit resulting from the accident, met with
top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Police</ENAMEX> officials in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> to express his concerns.
<p>
   Although he recalls telling the officials, including Secretary
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Safety</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathleen O'Toole</ENAMEX> that ``pilots no longer seemed to
practice autorotations when returning from a mission as had been
past practice,'' neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Toole</ENAMEX> nor two state police majors who
attended the meeting recalled that specific warning.
<p>
   In addition to that manager's warning, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1994</TIMEX> Sgt.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Welby</ENAMEX>, an air-wing pilot, wrote a report containing his
belief that officers were not being adequately trained in emergency
procedures. All pilots later received training, though a
recommendation for advanced training had been denied because of a
lack of funding.
<p>
   The report issued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welby</ENAMEX>'s concerns were communicated
to Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Henderson</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henderson</ENAMEX> ``does not recall
receiving the document.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henderson</ENAMEX> has since retired as head of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Police</ENAMEX> after being pressured to leave, in part because of
the fatal crash.
<p>
   One <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Police</ENAMEX> lieutenant said that, although the wing met
technical training requirements, ``he did not feel that formal
training was up to the standards one would expect.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Toole</ENAMEX> issued a statement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, saying, ``My thoughts and
prayers go out to the families of the crash victims as they once
again relive the tragedy that befell us all. Although nothing can
be done to return those lost I am pleased with the comprehensive
nature of this report.''
<p>
   The report reviews significant changes that have been made since
the crash, and others that are planned.
<p>
   So far, aviation consultants have been hired to reorganize the
air wing, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of State Police</ENAMEX> is seeking additional
money to replace aircraft and ground facilities, more training has
been required of air-wing managers, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Framingham</ENAMEX> fuel
facility has been permanently closed.
<p>
   The report ruled out any acts of sabotage, but it said that
among police management there was ``organizational confusion
resulting from a lack of designated responsibility'' for taking
care of the fuel facility.
<p>
   Water contamination in the fuel found in the system of the
wrecked helicopter ranged from 2.5 to nine times the allowable
limit.
<p>
   ``We have learned from this tragedy,'' says the report, signed
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reed V. Hillman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Police</ENAMEX> superintendent.

ROUGH SEAS PARALYZE SEARCH FOR PLANE WRECKAGE
(sw)

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SMITHTOWN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  On the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50th day after the crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World
Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 800</TIMEX>, senior investigators said that persistent
rough seas off the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> had paralyzed efforts to
collect the remaining wreckage of the shattered jumbo jet.
<p>
   The only activity by divers in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past seven days</TIMEX> was one
six-hour mission completed early on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert
Francis</ENAMEX>, the vice chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety
Board</ENAMEX>, said. The divers, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> ship Grapple, were able to
reach the last remaining large field of debris, but rising seas on
the surface and storm-stirred silt on the bottom reduced visibility
to almost zero and limited them to one haul of only a dozen small
pieces of wreckage, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Even those pieces remained on the stern of the ship as seas grew
rougher on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, leaving investigators ashore with no new flow
of potential clues to the cause of the explosion that split the jet
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 17</TIMEX>, killing all 230 people aboard.
<p>
   With one hurricane recently departed and another one stirring
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> anew, conditions were so bad on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said, that a wave knocked him into the water as it swept
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> speedboat carrying him and several other investigators to
the Grapple.
<p>
   ``Fortunately, the admiral was kind enough to come back and get
me,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said of Rear Adm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Kristensen</ENAMEX>, the pilot of the
speedboat and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> officer in charge of the salvage effort.
<p>
   Even though more than two-thirds of the aircraft had been
recovered as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week ago</TIMEX>, and much of that debris has been
closely scrutinized, criminal and transportation investigators say
they still lack sufficient evidence to show that the explosion was
caused by a bomb or missile rather than a mechanical failure.
<p>
   In a new sign that investigators still lacked many of the pieces
shed by the airplane in the earliest moments of its disintegration,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said that as soon as weather permitted a sonar sweep of the
bottom would be extended west and south of the areas that had
already been searched.
<p>
   The decision to backtrack another half mile along the ill-fated
plane's path from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy International Airport</ENAMEX> was made after a
new analysis of the last radar traces of pieces falling from the
airplane, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kristensen</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Despite the lack of new wreckage pulled from the ocean, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX>
said, investigative teams at a complex of hangars in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calverton</ENAMEX>,
were still busy working with what they already had. He said new
pieces were added on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> to a growing reconstruction of the
cabin between the wings.
<p>
   But some of the most coveted pieces of wreckage were still
missing, he said, including many parts of the center fuel tank,
which sat under a group of seats that many investigators say were
the likely center of the explosion.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> confirmed previous reports that two seats
at the right end of row 23 had large holes ripped in their metal
backs. ``They may turn out to be significant,'' he said, but he
cautioned that ``there are a lot of ways things can get holes in
them after an airplane accident.''
